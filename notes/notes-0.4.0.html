<h2>Beta 0.4.0 Update Notes</h2>


<p>Greetings wonderful supporters and friends. Today marks a significant milestone for Foundry Virtual Tabletop as the software moves into the 0.4.x version on the path towards release. This is a major update version which evolves the software in some very significant ways. In addition to the update notes, there are some critical changes to the installation and usage of the software which are detailed in the post containing the download links for the software. Please be sure to read those notes carefully as well.</p>

<p>This update is a generational step investing in the underlying infrastructure of the software. As a consequence of that, most of the big new features in 0.4.0 deal with underlying features, networking, application structure, and data structure. This results in relatively fewer big client-side changes this time around, but I want to make sure everyone understands how the technical investments made in the 0.4.0 launch are critical to empower further growth for the platform.</p>

<p>The biggest gameplay-altering feature in the 0.4.0 update is a <strong>major update to the D&D5E system</strong> which almost completely overhauls and expands the system data model to empower more robust data stored on every actor and item as well as an entirely new interface and design for Actor and Item sheets. In addition to 5e improvements, the <strong>Simple Worldbuilding</strong> system has been redesigned to offer more flexibility as a system agnostic toolkit which is compatible with the 0.4.x release.</p>

<p>Thank you all for appreciating my work, providing thoughtful feedback, and for your patience during this update cycle which I realize is more disruptive than usual.</p>
