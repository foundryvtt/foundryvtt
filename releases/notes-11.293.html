<section id="update-overview">
    <p class="note warning"> Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Version 11 Prototype 2 release of Foundry Virtual Tabletop! Our team has invested extensively into the technical foundation of our software with this release, making some big and meaningful changes that improve the architecture, performance, and user experience of Foundry VTT. Some of the most noteworthy highlights include further investment into our new LevelDB infrastructure to support fully hierarchical document operations, support for Folder documents inside Compendium packs, migration to PIXI.js version 7 and its new interaction framework, and a complete overhaul of the Setup screen views of the application which introduces a new visual theme to the software.</p>
    <p>In addition to these major features, we have delivered a large number of smaller features like new weather effects, improvements to threshold walls, improved data compression to facilitate loading on slower internet connections, and much more. As a Prototype build, there are a small number of breaking changes which community developers should be aware of. Please check out the full list of changes below for a detailed breakdown of everything that V11 Prototype 2 brings to Foundry Virtual Tabletop!</p>

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Updates on the Prototype channel provide the implementation of major new features which are likely to introduce unforeseen bugs, breakages to existing game systems or modules, or other problems which will be disruptive to the usage of the software. Do not install this update unless you are doing so for the specific purposes of testing, it is not intended for use in 'live game' scenarios. The purpose of Prototype builds are to allow new experimental features to be tested and to help developers to begin the process of updating packages which are impacted by these changes. If you choose to update to this version you expose yourself to serious risk of having a bad experience. Please take this warning to heart.</p>

    <h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>
    <p>We've been hard at work, making a lot of progress in the form of architectural improvements and other changes that are easy to overlook outside the development community, but which are no less important for all our users! As always, the full details of what this update contains are outlined below, but there are some key features this introduces which we hope you'll enjoy. In addition to several bug fixes and API improvements, this update introduces the first steps in our upgrade to the user interface, provides a prompt for users to opt-in to send us usage statistics, introduces Folders to Compendium Packs, includes our migration to using PIXI Version 7, and adds new features to embedded (grandchild) Documents.</p>
    
    <h3>The Setup</h3>
    <p>As part of an ongoing effort streamline the UX and UI of Foundry VTT, V11P2 introduces our brand-new UI for the setup and world login pages. The new setup screen brings new functionality, a more convenient layout, responsive design, a News section, and ability for us to showcase Featured Content from our community of developers, content creators, and partners.</p>
    <p>In addition, we have moved many of the buttons that were once repeated on individual menu items into a simple context menu. We also added a prompt to notify you that you should set an administrator password, in the event you have not. Any warnings or errors detected when launching Foundry VTT are now conveniently organized into an error log, which you can view by clicking the "Warnings" button in the top-right corner, just next to the new configuration button.</p>

        </a>
        <figcaption>The World Login screen now supports an additional view, the default is shown here. <br/>The alternative "minimal" display removes the World Description and Game Details section, for a more simplified login page. </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </figure>
    <p>The World Login page has also gotten a style update, offering the option for both a traditional "default" display, showcasing game details and a robust world description— or a more simplified "minimal" option that only displays the log in and return to setup fields.</p>
    <p>We're very pleased with the direction that the new UI design has taken, and are excited to finally show it off to the community— but we also know there are still changes we need to bring, so please be considerate with any criticism you may have. We hope you'll all find it as aesthetically pleasing as we do!</p>

    <h3>Get Organized with Compendium Folders</h3>
    <p>Compendium Packs can now contain Folders! Often requested by our users and publishing partners, this long-awaited feature makes it possible to import and export Folders between your World and a Compendium while keeping your Documents organized. You can search, collapse, and expand Compendium Folders just like in the sidebar, and interact with the Documents contained within them in the same way. As an added bonus, we've also increased the maximum number of folders you can have nested in the sidebar from 3 to 4.</p>

    <h3>Web Workers Upgrading Our PIXIes</h3>
    <p><a href="https://pixijs.com/" target="_blank">PIXI.js</a>, the canvas rendering engine and library that Foundry Virtual Tabletop relies upon, has released a major new version: PIXI v7. As part of Foundry VTT Version 11 we have onboarded this new version and updated our canvas rendering code to use all the new PIXI v7 features. One of the most significant areas where these improvements appear are with an overhaul of our mouse interaction workflows where we use a new events engine. This work has simplified our codebase and improved performance using canvas that now closely mirrors how events work for HTML elements. Additionally, adoption of PIXI v7 adds new powerful features that improve API capabilities for module developers and improve performance for end users. </p>
    <p>Developers whose modules modify the Canvas will want to read up on the <a href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/wiki/v7-Migration-Guide" target="_blank">PIXI v7 Migration Guide</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Updating the Grandkids</h3>
    <p>When we migrated to LevelDB during Prototype 1, we gained a lot of benefits- one of which is that it allows us to relax some of the restrictions we had to put in place on Embedded Documents. Grandchild Embedded Documents (contained on an item that an actor owns) and other nested documents can now be created, read, updated and deleted in the same way as their parent Documents without having to process the update through the parent. In short, for the non-developers: the Active Effect on your character's magic sword can now be updated directly!</p>   
    
    <h3>Opt-In Statistics</h3>
    <p>With the launch of Version 11, users will be prompted at first-launch to consider whether they'd like to opt-in to send us anonymous usage statistics. If enabled, Foundry VTT software will periodically send anonymized data to us for our own use. This can be toggled off from the setup configuration menu at any time, and when disabled the software will not send us any data that it has gathered.</p>
    <p>We have always been a very privacy-focused company when it comes to our users and their data, so we'd like to take this moment to reassure everyone: that isn't significantly changing. We understand this is a very, very thorny topic, so we aren't making any changes without looking really closely at how it might impact our community.</p>
    <p>We want you to know that we respect your data and your privacy.</p>

    <p>In support of these changes we have updated our <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/license/" target="_blank">End User License Agreement</a> to version 11.293, and also updated our <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. In anticipation of some community questions about this, we've also prepared a short Q&A:</p>
    
    <section class="collapsible">
        <header class="collapsible-header">Opt-in Stats: Questions and Answers</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <blockquote class="question">
                <p>How do these statistics help?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There are a few ways that anonymous usage statistics can be beneficial both from a company and community perspective:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Better focus for our internal testing by accommodating game systems and modules which are more popular within the community.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We would be able to make informed development decisions regarding software compatibility.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ability to answer questions from the community and our publishing partners about which game systems are most popular on our service.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Community developers could be granted insight into the popularity of their modules.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are a few other ways, but this is probably a comprehensive enough list for now.</p>
            <blockquote class="question">
                <p>Will I be able to see what data is going to be sent?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Yes! the usage statistics will be stored locally in a JSON file which can be viewed by the server host. The file is stored at <code>{User Data}/Logs/diagnostics.json</code>. This step was taken intentionally to allow for transparency on what data we're gathering. Even when disabled, you can access this file to see what data we would send if you were to enable it.</p>
            <blockquote class="question">
                <p>Will this ever become opt-out, or mandatory?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We don't ever want to force our users to report statistics about their hosted servers. We chose to make this opt-in after careful consideration of what it would mean to our community, and as a team we really don't like the idea of mandatory gathering of data.</p>
            <blockquote class="question">
                <p>Will this affect performance?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As this operation is a very minimal data-writing operation, it shouldn't have any impact on performance.</p>
            <blockquote class="question">
                <p>Are you going to sell this data to other companies?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Absolutely not. We don't think of our community members as commodities.</p>        
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <p>We hope that you will consider enabling these statistics to benefit our development efforts, but we understand completely if you choose not to! As always, what you choose to do with your Foundry VTT server is your decision.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header border">Known Issues</h2>
    <h3>Documents and Data</h3>
    <p>This release includes some of our preliminary work to refactor Synthetic Actors, but it is only partially completed and as a result there are some issues which community developers should be aware of. We intend to resolve these in our next release. Please see issue <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8907" target="_blank">(8907)</a> for further details. We felt that it was important to get this portion of the work (<code>ActorDelta</code>) out during the prototype phase to solicit some feedback from our community developers. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Existing worlds migrated to v11 will potentially have non-functioning unlinked tokens if they already exist on a scene. Any newly-created unlinked tokens should function as normal.</li>
        <li>Any changes made to an embedded documents contained within an unlinked token will copy the entire document collection from the base actor (the same as v10 behaviour).</li>
        <li>Updating an Active Effect embedded in an unlinked token actor's owned Item should correctly be persisted, but the client may not update correctly currently, and may require a refresh to see the changes.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="section-header border">Breaking Changes</h2>
    <h3 id="breaking-docs" class="category-header">Documents and Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We now provide <code>DataModel._initializationOrder</code> as a generator which customizes the field initialization order for a model to be potentially different than the order of fields defined in the schema. This allows hierarchical fields like embedded collections to be initialized last.<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8800" target="_blank">(8800)</a></li>
        <li>The instance-level <code>DataModel.prototype._validateModel</code> method for applying joint validation rules to a <code>DataModel</code> has been moved and renamed as a static <code>DataModel.validateJoint</code> method. Backwards compatibility is applied for the instance method until v13. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8969" target="_blank">(8969)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="breaking-canvas" class="category-header">The Game Canvas</h3>
    <ul>

<h2 class="section-header border">API Improvements</h2>
    <h3 id="api-architecture" class="category-header">Architecture and Infrastructure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Expanded <code>WorldCollection</code>s to include a <code>folders</code> property that resolves to all Folders that contain Documents of that type. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8902" target="_blank">(8902)</a></li>
        <li>Drag handling in <code>SidebarTab</code> has been improved, allowing the creation of pre-sorted documents. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8903" target="_blank">(8903)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="api-docs" class="category-header">Documents and Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We now perform joint model validation recursively for all embedded models as part of a <code>DataModel#validate</code> workflow which designates <code>{joint: true}</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8727" target="_blank">(8727)</a></li>
        <li>Enhanced Compendium Pack API to support Folders. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8786" target="_blank">(8786)</a></li>

        <li>Expanded the <code>ActiveEffect</code> data model to include a <code>statuses</code> field which contains a set of <code>statusId</code> strings for different configured conditions. Statuses previously set using <code>flags.core.statusId</code> are automatically migrated to this set. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8880" target="_blank">(8880)</a></li>
        <li>Added the <code>SchemaField#getField</code> method which can traverse the tree and obtains the <code>DataField</code> definition for a given field path (<code>NumberField</code>, <code>SchemaField</code>, etc.). <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8906" target="_blank">(8906)</a></li>
        <li>Added an <code>EmbeddedDocumentField</code> and refactored core embedded Document handling to accommodate singleton embedded Documents as well as embedded collections. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8964" target="_blank">(8964)</a></li>
        <li>Improved the way that pre-flight data model updates are validated with the addition of <code>DataModel#updateSource(changes, {dryRun: true})</code> which attempts a model update using the full validation stack but does not apply the final result. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8966" target="_blank">(8966)</a></li>
        <li>Improved the workflow of <code>ClientDatabaseBackend#_preUpdateDocumentArray</code> to perform dry-run data model updates which incorporate client-side joint model validation before dispatching an update to the server. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8967" target="_blank">(8967)</a></li>
        <li>Exceeding folder maximum depth now raises an error rather than allowing the creation of a folder that is not visible within the UI. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8972" target="_blank">(8972)</a></li>
        <li>It is now possible to import Adventure documents programmatically. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8750" target="_blank">(8750)</a></li>
        <li><code>isEmpty</code> now returns <code>true</code> for <code>null</code> values. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8826" target="_blank">(8826)</a></li>
        <li>Grandchild embedded documents can now be edited due to improvements with the new LevelDB architecture. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8899" target="_blank">(8899)</a></li>

    </ul>
    <h3 id="api-apps" class="category-header">Applications and User Interface</h3>
    <ul>
