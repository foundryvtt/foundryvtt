</figure>

<p>Welcome to the first beta channel update in the Foundry Virtual Tabletop 0.8.x series! This update focuses on continued series of improvements that were the focus of 0.8.x, including a new audio engine for improved Playlists and audio functionality, improvements to the dice system, a brand new Overhead Tiles system, and a complete overhaul of data structures for the purposes of standardizing the API. The incorporation of another 1500 pieces of icon artwork available to all users, and a substantial number of user experience improvements, bug fixes, and API enhancements.</p>
<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Beta channel releases have the potential to introduce breaking bugs that may be disruptive to play. These features are close to ready for a stable release - but likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. If your game in particular relies upon a large number of add-on modules, it would be best to wait for the stable release.</p>
<p>If are upgrading the Foundry Virtual Tabletop <strong>application</strong> to 0.8.3 from 0.7.9 <strong>you must perform a fresh installation of the software</strong>. Because of some of the infrastructure changes it is only possible to update to this version from within the Foundry VTT application if you are already using 0.8.0. This does not apply to users running <strong>dedicated servers</strong> with Node 14+.</p>
<p>As always, before any significant update:</p>
<p class="note warning">Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>

<h3 class="border">Update Overview</h3>

<p>The 0.8.3 update primarily focused upon bringing bug fixes for some of the more prominent bugs that appeared during the 0.8.2 testing process and addresses a great number of those. The 0.8.3 update incorporates all of the changes documented in updates 0.8.0 through 0.8.2. You can read the full update notes for each individual release in the 0.8.x series using the following links:</p>
<ol>
    <li>https://foundryvtt.com/releases/0.8.0</li>
    <li>https://foundryvtt.com/releases/0.8.1</li>
    <li>https://foundryvtt.com/releases/0.8.2</li>
</ol>
<p>The highlights of these features are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Overhead Tiles allow GMs to set tiles as overhead (which are rendered above the token layer) or as roofs (which appear above the token and light layer) in order to provide functionality for GMs to give a visually distinct appearance to tree canopies, roofs, clouds, or other things that would visually obscure tokens. Overhead tiles also include the option to set an occlusion mode which will change the opacity of the tile when a token moves below it. If a tile has its occlusion mode set to Fade (entire tile) it will lower its transparency to the configured Occlusion Alpha when a Token is beneath it. If its Occlusion Mode is set to Roof (lighting and vision) it will also obscure light sources below it when it is visible.</li>
    <li>New audio system which replaces HowlerJS with a new, more powerful engine based on the native Web Audio API. This new audio system brings great gains in stability and is not just more performant, but also brings with it support for fading audio, better easing for ambient audio sources, and a number of UX improvements.</li>
    <li>The dice parser has been refactored and brings a lot of overall improvements in the way dice formulae are handled. In addition this update introduces the ability for dice rolls to be made asynchronous through the API, exposing new, more powerful functionality for Dice addons to use.</li>
    <li>0.8.0 brought a complete refactor and revision to the Foundry VTT API, standardizing a lot of functions and ushering in a new "Common Document Model" which provides a renovated set of abstractions for documents, data schema, database operations, and much more. This is a major step away from the legacy concepts of "Entities" and "Embedded Entities". A byproduct of the improved Document model is a significant improvement in the flexibility and re-usability of the Document API - which is especially evident in areas like Compendium documents or unlinked Token Actors which were previously difficult to work with.</li>
    <li>Backend improvements for packages bringing additional benefits for dependencies as well as a number of new small features for the general users, including the ability to lock a module or system to prevent it from updating beyond its current version.</li>
    <li>More than 1,500 new icons have been added, the majority of which are "action" oriented, depicting skills, abilities, and magic spells!</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="border">Breaking Changes</h3>
<h4>Documents and Data</h4>
<ul>
    <li>As of 0.8.0 package manifests are now managed by the DocumentData architecture. It is not possible for these JSON files to include additional arbitrary fields which are not part of the defined schema. In recognition to a number of modules and system devs we have implemented a new <code>flags</code> field to manifest JSONs which will allow for storing arbitrary key value pairs.</li>
    <li>To prevent a namespace collision with <code>Document#parent</code>, the <code>Folder#parent</code> attribute has been renamed to <code>Folder#parentFolder</code>.</li>
    <li>Package validation changes prematurely considered module names with capital letters as invalid. While this is in keeping with our documentation on naming conventions and requirements, a change of this magnitude was not intended to be done without warning. In the future we will be evaluating the necessity of this with a more clear path to deprecation and migration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="border">New Features</h3>
<h4>The Game Canvas</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The Tile configuration sheet has been extended and now supports changing the zIndex of a tile for more specific placement above or below other tiles.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Interface and Applications</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The package lock icon now has a helpful tooltip to explain its purpose.</li>
    <li>New player accounts now default to no longer include a space in order to reduce difficulties some players may experience with whispering usernames that contain a space.</li>
    <li>Improved the error messaging surrounding sending messages to invalid users or sending invalid messages to an existing user to make it more clear what the error was determined to be.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dice System</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Roll commands will no longer automatically and presumptively close parentheses and curly-brackets from dice roll formulae, and will instead throw an error if they are detected. This is necessary to ensure precise validation of dice roll formulae.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="border">API Improvements</h3>
<h4>Documents and Data</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The <code>deepClone</code> utility method has been improved and should now skip over advanced Object structures which are not compatible with cloning.</li>
    <li>Propagating changes made to a base <code>Actor</code> document onward to unlinked <code>TokenDocument</code> instances which reference that Actor's data now uses the <code>TokenDocument</code> class for an improved workflow.</li>
    <li>Provide an option as part of the <code>DocumentModificationContext</code> that allows for document create operations to try and preserve an existing <code>_id</code> rather than forcibly discarding and re-generating it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Interface and Applications</h4>
<ul>
    <li><code>_restoreScrollPositions()</code> should now be called after render hooks are fired to ensure restoration of the scroll position is correctly applied.</li>
    <li>General improvements have been made to module and system load order.</li>
    <li><code>Dialog.prompt</code> now provides a more informative error message that explains that the prompt was closed without having a response chosen.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other Features</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Dependencies for aws-sdk, electron, electron-builder, express-handlebars, npm, socket-io, socket-io-client, terser, and tinymce have been updated.</li>
</ul>
