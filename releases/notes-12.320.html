<section id="update-overview">
    <p>We are eager to announce and share the release of <strong>Foundry Virtual Tabletop Version 12 Testing 1 (Build 320)</strong>, our first release of the Testing Phase for Version 12!</p>
    <p class="note info"><strong>WARNING:</strong>  This Testing update is intended for those dedicated users who wish to test the new features provided in Version 12. It is not intended for use in weekly games or in games with heavy use of add-on modules. The goal for this build is to collect preliminary testing feedback from developers and users, not to power actual game sessions!
    <p>As part of the Testing phase, this update is less focused on new features and more focused on starting to polish them up and delivering fixes. As we refine our designs during the upcoming testing releases, you can expect further improvements along these lines!</p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that features and user interfaces (particularly Scene Regions) will continue to evolve as we start the journey towards a Stable release.</p>
    <p class="note warning">As always, it is very important to back up your user data before any major update. It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended to backup your important Worlds before experimenting with the Testing Build. Better yet, consider taking a <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/backups/">full Snapshot</a>.</p>

<section id="highlights">
    <h2 class="section-header border">Update Highlights</h2>
        <p>While this release focuses primarily on steady improvements to V12, there is one new feature that we'd like to highlight and explain a bit further.</p>
    
    <h3>"Dynamic" Global Illumination for Scene Regions</h3>
    <section class= "columns">
    <section class="column">
        <p>Properly illuminating a Scene that contains a mix of "lit" and "unlit" spaces has always been challenging. This often happens when you have a dark indoor space near an outdoor setting and is particularly tricky if the players might visit the area during the day or night.</p>
        <p>This common situation can now be resolved using Scene Regions and an existing Scene configuration setting.</p>
        <h4>TL;DR</h4>
            <p>Even if Global Illumination is enabled for your Scene, you can now make a building, cave, or similar area mechanically "unlit" just by darkening it with a Scene Region.</p>
        <h4>The Nitty Gritty</h4>
            <p>Scenes already have an existing setting called the "Global Illumination Threshold." This setting allows you to easily use the same Scene during the "day" or "night" by automatically disabling Global Illumination when the Scene is dark enough. A Scene's darkness can be controlled by configuring its "Darkness Level" setting or by clicking the "Transition to Night" lighting control.</p>
            <p>In the first incarnation of Scene Regions, you could darken a part of the map visually using the Adjust Darkness behavior, essentially making it dimmer, but this would have no mechanical effect on Token vision. Now, if the darkness of the Scene Region meets the Scene's Global Illumination threshold, the area automatically becomes mechanically "unlit" as well. That is, tokens will no longer be able to see inside that region unless they have some other detection mode or source of illumination.</p>

<section id="features">
    <h2 class="section-header border">New Features</h2>
        <h3 id="features-canvas" class="category-header">The Game Canvas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The existing Scene-level Global Illumination Threshold now also applies to Scene Regions that use the Adjust Darkness behavior. When this threshold is set, you can now exclude the Scene Region from Global Illumination just by darkening it. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10749" target="_blank">(10749)</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="scene-regions" class="category-header">Scene Regions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When a Scene Region is hovered or selected, the entire row of Scene Regions is now highlighted in the Region Legend. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10719" target="_blank">(10719)</a></li>
            <li>Applied a random color to newly created Scene Regions rather than having them be colorless by default. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10745" target="_blank">(10745)</a></li>
            <li>Added an indicator for a Scene Region's assigned color in the Scene Region legend. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10724" target="_blank">(10724)</a></li>
            <li>Added a "Delete All" button to the Scene Region controls. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10707" target="_blank">(10707)</a></li>
            <li>For consistent UX with similar canvas objects, <code>ALT</code> (instead of <code>CTRL</code>) is now used to lock aspect ratio when placing a Scene Region's Shape. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10718" target="_blank">(10718)</a></li>
            <li>Added a button to the Scene Region legend to create an empty Scene Region. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10738" target="_blank">(10738)</a></li>
            <li>Elevation ranges are now set at the Scene Region level and are now uniform across the entire Scene Region. To support this, the bottom/top elevation was removed from <code>BaseShapeData</code> and added to the <code>RegionDocument</code> instead. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10742" target="_blank">(10742)</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="features-architecture" class="category-header">Architecture and Infrastructure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented <code>winston-daily-rotate-file</code> to reduce the file size impact of error and debug logs. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9972" target="_blank">(9972)</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="features-apps" class="category-header">Applications and User Interface</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a client setting to allow the user to choose whether the Application V2 theme should be light mode, dark mode, or match the browser default theme. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10678" target="_blank">(10678)</a></li>
            <li>Suppressed notification pips for new core versions when you are using a game system that does not yet support that version. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9572" target="_blank">(9572)</a></li>
            <li>Improved the <code>UserConfig</code> to more clearly organize the Actors that a User can pick and to indicate whether the User owns that Actor or is simply an observer.<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9892" target="_blank">(9892)</a></li>
            <li>The detection mode "Basic Sight" was renamed to "Darkvision" to better indicate that this detection mode controls Token vision in non-illuminated areas. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10728" target="_blank">(10728)</a></li>
        </ul>

            <li>Explicitly named <code>ItemSheetV2</code> so that it now has a "V2" suffix in the class name. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10658" target="_blank">(10658)</a></li>
            <li>Loosened restriction on settings menu applications so they can be Application V2 instances or classes. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/10680" target="_blank">(10680)</a></li>
