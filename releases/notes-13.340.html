<section id="update-overview">
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> This Testing update is intended for those dedicated users who wish to test the new features provided in Version 13. It is not intended for use in weekly games or in games with heavy use of add-on modules. The goal for this build is to collect preliminary testing feedback from developers and users, not to power actual game sessions!</p>
    <p>We're closing in on the stable build of V13, and while we have a few minor issues left on the table for consideration we're considering this current build feature complete. We expect that, unless there are significant surprises during testing, this build will be promoted to stable with minimal changes!</p>
    <p>While this update focused almost entirely on bug fixes and final polish on the UX and UI, we also managed to find a little time to squeeze in a few new features that deserve a little attention.</p>
    <h3>Portable Build, Portable Folder</h3>
    <p>In our last few releases we began including a new 'portable' build for windows users that didn't require a full installation. As of this release, and going forward, the portable build for windows is now contained within an App folder and, at first launch, will create a separate folder for Config, Data, and Logs in its parent folder. The portable build will automatically use its parent folder as a User Data folder, and it no longer relies on an automatically created user-specific folder stored in <code>%appdata%</code> stored on the local computer. The good news is it's now far easier to slap a copy of Foundry VTT on a USB drive and take it with you. The bad news is when updating this particular type of release you'll have to be super careful not to delete the <code>Data</code> folder or you'll lose all your work!</p>
    <h3>Love The Way You Move</h3>
    <figure class="right"><img src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/asset/user_671/movement-types-demo-2025-04-17.gif"/>
        <figcaption>A Token menu showcasing an early version of the available movement types</figcaption>
       </figure>
            <p>As you all know we've been working hard to bring a refined drag-measurement experience to moving your tokens. This update brings a new change that snuck in just under the wire: the ability to define what 'type' of movement you are taking.</p>
            <p>The Token HUD got a little update to offer a menu for selecting type of movement, including a variety of common movement styles- your character tokens can now walk, fly, climb, burrow, teleport, swim, crawl, and more! We expect game systems will leverage movement styles to adapt them to their own particular game rules, so the whole list can be extended.</p>
            <p>Users who wish to flip through the available types of movement while currently moving can do so using the Tab key, allowing for a quick and convenient way to illustrate that your character walked a short distance, jumped over a hole, then walked a little more before climbing a ladder. </p>
    <h3>All of the Application V2</h3>
    <p>At long last we've finished the conversion of all our UI applications to use our ApplicationV2 framework, including the new theme and styling for each. While this hardly represents the last iteration of our user experience, all of our current UX and UI elements are now using the powerful new Application V2 framework in a way that makes them far more extensible and customizable. In addition, the entire application (perhaps with the exception of the Chat Log) is now automatically styled to match your computer's theme preferences, shifting to light mode or dark mode as desired.</p>
    <p>We hope everyone enjoys the new user interface and looks forward to future improvements! </p>

<section id="breaking">
<h2 class="section-header border">Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>These changes, while technically breaking, should only minimally impact a limited number of developers who have already updated these parts of their code to adopt v13 practices. After deliberation, given the low-level impact of these changes and the fact that the resolution for users who had already made changes is a single-line code change, we concluded that it would best for us to make this change now rather than in the future when more developers may have switched. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>chatBubble</code> hook has been deprecated in favor of the <code>chatBubbleHTML</code> hook, which is passed <code>HTMLElement</code> instead of <code>jQuery</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12463" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(12463)</a></li>
        <li><code>DialogV2ButtonCallback</code> and <code>DialogV2RenderCallback</code> now expect a <code>DialogV2</code> instance in the <code>dialog</code> argument, rather than a <code>DialogV2#element</code>.  <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12525" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(12525)</a></li>
        <li>The <code>teleport</code> waypoint property of paths passed to <code>BaseGrid#measurePath</code> now measures distance and number of grid spaces/diagonals the same way as non-teleport segments. Previously teleportation segment were measured as 0 distance. The default cost of teleportation segments is still 0. Developers wishing to skip the measurement of this segment entirely may use the <code>measure</code> waypoint property.<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12518" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(12518)</a></li>
