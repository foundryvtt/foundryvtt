<section id="update-overview">
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>
    <p>We're excited to bring you the second release in the Feature Testing phase of our development cycle. Feature Testing releases are designed to allow power users and those with strong stomachs to experience new features as we grow closer to a stable release for the general public! V11 Testing 2 is focused on correcting bugs and improving the UX and UI of features newly introduced in Version 11, based on feedback from our development community. If you are interested in providing feedback on these early testing builds, now is the time to check them out! Be cautious, however. Testing builds are not intended for use in weekly games or in heavily-modified Worlds.</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Releases on the Testing channel have the potential to introduce bugs that may be disruptive to play. These features are close to a stable release - but likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. While these releases are intended for testing by the average user, we do not recommend you use them yet in your long running campaigns. We instead ask you try them out in a new World or one-shot with no modules.</p>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>
<h3>Perfect Foundry VTT</h3>
<p>While Foundry VTT may not be perfect, it's a bit closer with the latest addition of Eber to our team! Eber is the creator of great modules like <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/perfect-vision" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Perfect Vision</a> and <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/advanced-drawing-tools" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Advanced Drawing Tools</a> and we're very excited to have him on the team. Despite just starting this week he's already jumped into the deep end and has a number of fixes included in this release! We're looking forward to seeing all of the improvements that his geometric and graphical expertise can bring to the team and how it can help us to keep improving performance and adding new features to Foundry VTT.</p>

<h3>What do you hear Starbuck? Nothing but the rain... and doors.</h3>
<p>We have a number of great canvas improvements in this release including an update to the rain weather effect with better visuals and performance with new options to control the style of rain through the API. We have also included two new light animations ("Siren" and "Revolving") to help you make even more dramatic scenes thanks to SecretFire's Free Project Friday work. It's also now possible to control Walls by clicking on the Wall segment and not just their endpoints. You can give it a shot by clicking on all of your doors and setting them up with some of our 8 brand new door sounds courtesy of Cobalt! There are also a number of other small features like a new Token disposition that prevents a border from being displayed and hidden templates are now rendered with a 50% transparency.</p>

<h3>Folders Full of UI Improvements</h3>
<p>This release includes a ton of UI improvements across the software. Kim added granular imports to all Adventures, the ability to lock the hotbar to prevent changing the layout, and automatically scrolling to the last selected category when reopening the Settings Configuration app. Cody has continued the work to improve the sidebar with support for Adventures in Folders, duplicating Compendium Packs with their Folder structure intact and a new API for searching Collections.</p>
