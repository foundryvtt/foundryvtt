    <h2 class="border">Important Message from the Foundry VTT Developers</h2>
    <p class="note warning border">BEFORE UPDATING: If you read nothing else within these update notes, please read this section.</p>
    
    <p>If you are updating from V8 for the first time, you should know that while this release is marked as Stable, it does not guarantee the game worlds you have prepared will be 100% ready for the update. While a majority of game systems are V9-ready, there are some that have not updated and will not function. </p>
    
    <h3>Recommended Process for Updating</h3>
    <p>When updating to a new major version of Foundry Virtual Tabletop, please follow these specific steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Assess whether now is the time to update for your game worlds. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQB3hKXseLn1ROUxepiw09GYQPG8ikwZjY_Nkde9KnC9PUJA0gNWBuMIJ66iU0qokAbERQ8jF-Bwwrh/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">This spreadsheet will help</a>.)</li>
        <li>Perform a complete backup of your user data. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmbxMmqNNXU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Follow this handy guide</a>.)</li>
        <li>Make sure the backup you have created is stored somewhere safe. <u><strong>DO NOT</strong></u> store backup data in the user data folder. A seperate USB flashdrive is strongly recommended.</li>
        <li>To benefit from the new electron version and some specific changes to the software itself, we <strong>STRONGLY recommend</strong> doing an uninstallation of Foundry VTT and reinstalling compeletely instead of using the in-app updater for this version.</li>
        <li>Once you have updated the core software, <strong>before launching your game worlds</strong>, check for updates to your game systems and modules which will now be available.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>About Add-On Modules</h3>
    <p>Due to the changes implemented in Version 9, if you use any modules which change or alter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Canvas Lighting</li>
            <li>Token Vision</li>
            <li>Fog of War</li>
            <li>Card Support</li>
            <li>Keybindings</li>
        </ul>
     <p>You will want to ensure those modules are disabled for your game worlds before attempting to play.</p>   
    
    <h3>Troubleshooting the V9 Update</h3>
    <p>If you experience any issues, these quick steps and resources should help you resolve them in the most efficient manner:</p>
    <h4>Caching</h4>
        <p>There was a known issue with caching which causes some errors and UI oddities which can be addressed quickly and immediately without support asssistance. If a simple CTRL+F5 does not resolve the issue: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)</li> 
            <li>Click DevTools settings (<i class="fas fa-cog"> </i>)</li>
            <li>Under the <code>Network</code> heading check "Disable cache (while Devtools is open)"</li>
            <li>While DevTools open, refresh your Foundry VTT using the F5 key.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Disable Modules</h4>
        <p>If you are able to launch your world and have tried the DevTools cache fix, but are still experiencing issues, please disable all modules for your world and see if the issue is resolved. This will determine if the issue is module-related or originating from a core software bug.</p>
    <h4>Troubleshooting Specific Issues</h4>    
    <ul>
        <li>If neither of the above solutions solve your issue, you will find a new Support button on the settings tab of the sidebar. This will provide you with important data that can be conveniently copy-pasted to our community discord for assistance.</li>
        <li>You can access the debug and error logs for your server within the Logs folder of your user data directory. These will provide important troubleshooting information as well.</li>
        <li><a href="https://discord.gg/7qScDYDRNU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> You can access a (temporary) special discord channel set up for troubleshooting update issues here.</a></li>
    </ul>
    </div>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>

<p>As an update on the Stable channel, V9 Stable (9.240) brings a few key fixes for bugs discovered after the stable release. These are changes are relatively non-controversial and as such there isn't much to highlight. </p>
<p>To draw attention to some of the more prominent bugs fixed by this update: 
</p><ul>
    <li>We have resolved a number of issues related to the new keybindings system and extended ability to rebind macro hotbar buttons to different keys. </li>
    <li>We corrected a number of edge-case issues with vision and lighting which could result in rare cases where vision polygons were inaccurate. </li>
    <li>We took the opportunity to correct some issues with the import of actor data from compendium packs and JSON files, and doing so should now respect the stored data for folders, permissions, and prototype tokens. </li>
    <li>We resolved an issue which prevented saving of settings in the Audio/Video Chat Integration configuration window. </li>
    <li>We also corrected a number of UX/UI issues discovered with the handling of Cards. </li>
    <li>Lastly, we corrected a small but irritating bug which resulted in Ambient Sounds being incorrectly restrained by walls when they were set not to.</li>
</ul> 

<p>For a comprehensive list of everything we fixed, see below! </p>

        <li>Failed <code>DocumentData</code> instance construction resulting from use of a non-object (like a string or number) now logs an error and falls back to default values. This allows <code>Document</code> construction to continue if no other fatal validation errors occur. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6408" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6408</a>)</li>
        <li>HTML &lt;object&gt; tags have been whitelisted for rich text HTML fields. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6378" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6378</a>)</li>

        <li>Attempting to click on a scene while the canvas is disabled now raises a notification reminding users to enable the canvas before trying to switch scenes. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6440" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6440</a>)</li>
