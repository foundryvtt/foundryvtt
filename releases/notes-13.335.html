<section id="update-overview">
    <p>Welcome to the Version 13 Developer 2 release of Foundry Virtual Tabletop!</p>
    <p>With this release, our team has now completed the initial API-level work and built some preliminary user interfaces for exciting new features. As always, we have also invested extensively into the technical foundations of our software, adding further improvements to our lighting engine and API.</p> 
    <p>This release likely marks the conclusion of the Development phase of our work on Version 13. Our focus during the Development phase involved further refinements to prototype features and solidifying the API based on feedback from users in our Developer community. If you are a Module or System developer, this is the moment to test your packages in Version 13 in order to provide us with feedback and request any final API changes that would make your lives easier!</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Updates on the Development channel are intended for testing and feedback from the development community. While the features and improvements of these updates may be close to a level of stability intended for public testing, they are likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. Always backup any important data before testing, and please remember that <u><strong>this release is not intended to use in a live game</strong></u>.</p>

<section id="highlights">
    <h2 class="section-header border">Update Highlights</h2>
    <h3>Light Versus Darkness</h3>
    <p>Foundry V13 Dev 2 brings new developments in the eternal struggle between darkness and the light. When a lighting source and a darkness source overlap, you can now assign each source a "priority" to determine which one "wins" and gets to dictate the lighting in the areas of conflict.</p>
    <h3>Wait... Regions that Modify Movement Speed? Really?</h3>
    <p>Yes, really! As part of our work on the community-voted Drag Ruler feature, we saw an opportunity to help support the common situation where a certain area is mechanically more difficult (or easier!) to move through. This release includes the new "Modify Movement Cost" Region Behavior which offers core support for defining Regions that can apply a multiplier to the movement speed of Tokens that are within them. This core support can also be leveraged by Module and System Developers to implement system-specific rules such as difficult terrain in D&D or PF2E.</p>
    <h3>Prettier Roll Tables</h3>
    <p>Roll Tables, one of the older components of Foundry, got an overhaul while converting them to Application V2. A separate interface is now available for editing and viewing Roll Tables, resulting in a significantly smoother and aesthetic experience.</p>
    <h3>Moar AppV2 Conversions! Moar!</h3>
    <p>Several more major parts of Foundry got the ApplicationV2 treatment, including Compendiums, Playlists, Settings, the Scenes sidebar, and more.</p>

        <li>Added additional context to the result of <code>parseUuid</code>. If the parsed UUID has a compendium redirect, the redirected UUID is now also returned. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/11991" target="_blank">(11991)</a></li>
        <li>Added additional <code>HTMLProseMirrorElement</code> lifecycle events. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12061" target="_blank">(12061)</a></li>
        <li>Added <code>foundry.utils.cleanHTML</code>, which sanitizes HTML strings. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12071" target="_blank">(12071)</a></li>

        <li>Deleting the last combatant in the turn order during its turn now properly starts the turn of the next combatant instead of the previous combatant. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12009" target="_blank">(12009)</a></li>
        <li><code>Combat#previousTurn</code> no longer incorrectly changes turn if it is called in round 0. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12014" target="_blank">(12014)</a></li>

        <li>Resolved incorrect recursion limit handling in interactions between <code>TextEditor._embedContent</code> and <code>RollTable._buildEmbedHTML</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12020" target="_blank">(12020)</a></li>
        <li>Fixed a bug which was causing relative uuids do not resolve correctly on synthetic actors. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12023" target="_blank">(12023)</a></li>
        <li>Prevented a crash that could occur when using "Import Data" context option in the Items directory. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12027" target="_blank">(12027)</a></li>
        <li>Resolved a bug that was preventing adding changes to an active effect (AE) via the UI unless the AE already had changes. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12035" target="_blank">(12035)</a></li>
        <li>Prevented an error that could occur when toggling "Enable Markers" on or off in Combat Tracker Settings. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12037" target="_blank">(12037)</a></li>
        <li>Fixed missing assignment of the <code>parent</code> in <code>ArrayField#element</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12046" target="_blank">(12046)</a></li>
