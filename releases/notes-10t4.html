    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>
    <p>Now that the team is back at full capacity after GenCon, we have an exciting new release for Version 10! This Testing channel release focused on squashing bugs, improving the user experience, and enhancing the API based on feedback from the developer community.</p>
    <p>Do you want to contribute feedback during the testing phase, but are nervous you might risk your weekly game in doing so? Our friends at Encounter Library have published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74ZAp3xx3o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">very helpful video</a> that will guide you through the process of setting up a testing environment. For those wishing to just check if the systems and modules they use have been updated with V10 compatibility, we've published our usual <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRrcQL-r09Bi4MsbHUXlmOVx6DP4Ju143zRmk3HiUK2qU6gA3naxuSUcyv3EVhjMThXzJ_455jnyWfK/pubhtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">package compatibility spreadsheet</a>, and community developer Arcanist has published a new <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/mcc" rel="nofollow">Module Compatibility Checker</a> that will let you check compatibility from within any World. </p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Releases on the Testing channel have the potential to introduce bugs that may be disruptive to play. These features are close to a stable release - but likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. While these releases are intended for testing by the average user, we do not recommend you use them yet in your long running campaigns. We instead ask you try them out in a new World or one-shot with no modules.</p>

<section id="update-themes">
    <h2 class="section-header border">Update Highlights</h2>
    <p>With V10's stable release approaching fast, this Testing release is focused on dealing with bugs and polishing up the user experience as much as possible so we can have a smooth launch. As a result, this release doesn't include a lot of flashy features but it does continue to sand off rough edges for developers while still providing some new quality of life features for everyone.</p>
    <h4>User Experience</h4>
    <p>This update includes a number of improvements to the user experience like making the Configure Settings UI match the design and functionality of the Package Management window with categories to the left and a filter at the top, ensuring that confirmation windows are always brought to the forefront, making the journal sidebar collapsible, more tooltips around the application, and adding support for a user list or user colored pips when collaboratively editing a Journal Entry Page.</p>
    <h4>Enhancements to the API</h4>
    <p>There have been a number of improvements to the API including adding the ability to clone any data model, exposing more ProseMirror functions to more easily manipulate editor state, build a data model from another data model, and the clean up of a lot of no longer needed code.</p>
    <h4>Bug Hunt</h4>
    <p>As per usual, the team has been hard at work tracking down bugs and taking care of 40 issues that have been raised by our community in this update alone.</p>
