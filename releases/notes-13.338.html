<section id="update-overview">
    <p>We're excited to bring you Foundry VTT V13 Testing 3, the third release in the Feature Testing phase of our development cycle. This build is primarily focused on correcting bugs, improving the Foundry VTT API, and streamlining user experience based on feedback from our community.</p>
    <p>This may be the last chance to check things out and provide actionable feedback before Stable hits!</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> This Testing update is intended for those dedicated users who wish to test the new features provided in Version 13. It is not intended for use in weekly games or in games with heavy use of add-on modules. The goal for this build is to collect preliminary testing feedback from developers and users, not to power actual game sessions!</p>
</section>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>
<h3 class="border">Building Towards Greatness</h3>
<p>Foundry VTT V13 Testing 3 introduces two new build options:</p>
<h5>A Dedicated <code>Node.j</code>s Build</h5>
<p>This is now the lightweight, cross-platform version of Foundry VTT that should be used. It does not include an electron client, and all cross-platform dependencies are included.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this change is that the Linux build no longer needs to carry any cross-platform dependencies.</p>
<h5>The Windows Portable Build</h5>
<p>This new build type allows Windows users to conveniently test out new versions of Foundry VTT without disrupting their primary installation.</p>
<p class="note info">Before testing out a new major version of Foundry VTT, taking a Snapshot is recommended. At a minimum, you should always <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/backups">backup</a> all your important Worlds!</p>
<p>Once your data is safely backed up, here's how to use the Windows Portable build try out the new Foundry VTT version:<p>
<ol>
    <li>Triple-check that you backed up your data</li>
    <li><a href="https://foundryvtt.com/me/licenses">Download</a> the Windows Portable build of the version to test</li>
    <li>Extract the downloaded file</li>
    <li>In the extracted folder, double-click the <code>Foundry Virtual Tabletop.exe</code> file to launch it</li>
</ol>
<p class="warning note"><strong>WARNING: </strong>The Windows Portable build currently uses the same Foundry VTT User Data Folder as your "real" version of Foundry VTT. We strongly recommend creating and using a new Foundry VTT User Data Folder to test with instead.</p>
<h5>Configuring a Dedicated "Test" Foundry User Data Folder</h5>
<p>There are two different ways to create and use a test folder. First, create a new folder somewhere (for example, <code>D:\Foundry_VTT_User_Data_Test</code>). You can then tell Foundry VTT to use this new test user data folder in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>The Foundry VTT Setup Screen</strong></p>
        <p>The simplest way to ensure that you do not accidentally affect your real data while testing is to <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/configuration/#setup"></a> change the Foundry User Data Folder manually</a> before testing, but it may be easy to forget this step.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Windows shortcut</strong></p>
        <p>You can create a Windows shortcut that points to your portable <code>"Foundry Virtual Table Top.exe"</code>. You can then add a launch parameter to the end of the shortcut's target to automatically use your new test User Data folder like.</p>
        <p>For example, your shortcut's target might be: <code>"Foundry Virtual Tabletop.exe" --dataPath="D:\Foundry_VTT_User_Data_Test"</code>.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="border">Token Drag Moving Forward</h3>
<p>Based on user feedback, we have made some further refinements to the Token Drag Movement and Distance Measurement user experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-clicking now only removes a single waypoint instead of cancelling the entire process.</li>
        <li>Instead, you can now use the <span class="reference">ESC</span> key to cancel the entire process.</li>
        <li>You can no longer remove the last waypoint using the keyboard (formerly <span class="reference">ALT+F</span> by default) because it ended up feeling awkward in practice.</li>   
    </ul>
<p>We have also implemented a new labelling system for these two tools using HTML and CSS. These labels are designed to be as simple as possible and to be easily extended by our community developers.</p>
<hr>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <h4>Example 1: Simple Movement with Waypoints</h4>
        <p>At first, only the total movement displays. When using waypoints, the amount of movement past the last waypoint is also added (in parentheses).</p>
        <p>In this example, the monk takes a corner as they head towards a cave.</p>
    </div>

        <h4>Example 2: Complex Movement</h4>    
        <p>If elevation is non-zero at any point of the move, the current elevation and the amount of change after the last waypoint are also added (in parentheses).</p>
        <p>In this example, the monk first steps 5 feet down off a rock, descends an additional 20 feet to the road below, and then turns and heads into the cave.</p>

<h3 class="border">Migrating Toward Modern Architecture + Documentation Galore</h3>
<p>This release marks an important milestone for us: all JavaScript files have now been migrated to ESM under a single <code>foundry.mjs</code> module entrypoint, capstone-ing a multi-year modernization effort. Additionally, extensive effort was dedicated to fixing and improving API documentation throughout the software.</p>
<h3 class="border"><em>Oonts</em>! <em>Oonts</em>! <em>Oonts</em>! <em>Oonts</em>!</h3>
<p>On a much sillier note, you can now use the new Sound-Reactive Pulse animation to configure lights so they pulse in sync with your in-game audio. You can even set lights to react exclusively to bass, mid-tones, or treble—because... why not?
<p>Additionally, for module developers, we've exposed a brand-new <code>AudioHelper</code> API, providing real-time audio analysis data so you can build even more immersive and audio-reactive experiences.</p>
