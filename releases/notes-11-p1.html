<section id="update-overview">
    <p class="note warning"> Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>
    
    <p>We're extremely excited to share this update with the community. Version 11 Prototype 1 brings a number of new features, bug fixes, and improvements to Foundry Virtual Tabletop and is the first step in our development cycle for Version 11. Our overall goals for Version 11 include new features to strengthen Compendium Packs, improvements to Data Storage including a completely new Database engine to replace NeDB, and broad improvements to UX/UI features with a focus on consistency and stability. Please check out the full list of changes below for a detailed breakdown of what was changed in this update!</p>

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong>Updates on the Prototype channel provide the implementation of major new features which are likely to introduce unforeseen bugs, breakages to existing game systems or modules, or other problems which will be disruptive to the usage of the software. Do not install this update unless you are doing so for the specific purposes of testing, it is not intended for use in 'live game' scenarios. The purpose of Prototype builds are to allow new experimental features to be tested and to help developers to begin the process of updating packages which are impacted by these changes. If you choose to update to this version you expose yourself to serious risk of having a bad experience. Please take this warning to heart.</p>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>
<p>This Prototype build contains a wide variety of minor tweaks here and there, and in many places small changes that could have profound benefits. There are so many interesting new features that it was difficult deciding what was most deserving of attention! While there are some obvious big-ticket items, there are so many exciting new features, so before we get into the major highlights here are a few honorable mentions: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Objects placed on Scenes will now attempt to hold their position when scenes are resized.</li>
    <li>UI improvements for Playlists and Rollable Tables.</li>
    <li>A new Support and Issues UI displaying errors and warnings.</li>
    <li>Overall UI improvements for consistency and clarity.</li>
    <li>New "Fog" weather effect.</li>
    <li>and so much more...</li>
</ul>

<p>Version 11 Prototype 1 carries some pretty big changes to the underlying parts of Foundry VTT. As we look forward to our next prototype build, the major changes highlighted here will be built upon and expanded with further improvements. Small changes aside, we want to highlight some of the more exciting, bigger features this update includes:</p>

<h3>NeDB is Dead, Long Live LevelDB</h3>
<p>We have anticipated a time when we would need to retire NeDB as our database provider for some time. We&#39;re really excited to report that we have successfully shifted backend database storage to use LevelDB, including support for Sublevels. Here&#39;s the key highlights and benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migration of existing DB files is automatic and non-destructive (though any changes made after the migration will only apply to the LevelDB version of the data)</li>
<li>Improved performance in read/write and embedded document operations</li>
<li>Sublevels allow for specific changes to be made without having to rewrite entire lines of the DB</li>
<li>Previous API calls for DB operations should still work as expected (except for specific <code>getDocuments()</code> calls using complex query parameters.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtypical</h3>
<p>Want to create a module that makes journal pages for quests? A new type of actor with its own data? Modules can now define subtypes of documents. By defining the <code>documentTypes</code> field in manifests, you can add new document types to the document creation dropdown selector. This mirrors the functionality of defining subtypes of Documents in system template.json files. </p>
<ul>
<li>Documents support definition of a universal &quot;base&quot; subtype, and provide fallback sheets for cases where a module providing this data might not be available (whether disabled or otherwise)</li>
<li>Disabling a module that provides subtypes notifies users that a specific number of documents provided by that module will become unavailable</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pretty Little Packages</h3>
<p>We&#39;ve made some pretty awesome changes to package handling. Including new values for the Relationships field in manifests, elevated UI/UX for error handling, and more:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Persistent Storage</em>. Packages may now declare <code>&quot;persistentStorage&quot;: true</code> in manifest JSON files, which will treat any data stored within a &quot;storage&quot; subfolder in the package folder as protected. Any data stored in that folder will not be deleted when the package <strong>updates</strong>. It is important to note here: <strong>uninstalling</strong> a module with <code>persistentStorage</code> will still remove that persistent data. This mechanism exists solely to persist data through updates. </li>
<li><em>Relationship Improvements</em>. Packages can now define <code>relationships.recommends</code> which serve the function of installing optional, not mandatory, dependencies. Additionally, relationships between packages received some UI updates to show the reason a dependency may be missing or inactive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Harder, Better, Faster, Fogger</h3>
<p>We&#39;ve been hard at work in the lab testing a variety of fog machines for photorealism and performance and we&#39;ve emerged with some pretty awesome fog of war changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new optimized texture-based approach for fog of war significantly improves performance of fog of war rendering</li>
<li>Worker threads are now being used for fog of war rendering</li>
<li>Significant FPS improvements related to light and fog rendering</li>
<li>Framework laid for the future of a manual fog-of-war implementation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>No, not the operating system. We are expanding the capabilities of Walls to allow configuration of proximity-based activation thresholds. This allows walls to be impenetrable at a distance but transparent at close range. We think this is an innovative way to model windows or other apertures for top-down VTT gameplay. Additionally, walls which configure a proximity threshold can cause perception to be attenuated so you perceive further the closer you are to the wall. It's amazing stuff and feels really satisfying to use. Thanks are due to Caewok who worked with our team to workshop and develop this improvement.</p>
<h3>Electron and Node</h3>
<p>We&#39;ve updated a lot of dependencies in the core framework, including all the usual suspects such as Pixi, ProseMirror, and more-- but we&#39;ve also updated our Node requirement and Electron as well. Foundry VTT (node-hosted) will now require Node 16 at a minimum (18 recommended), but moreover we have moved to Electron 22 which brings support for &quot;V8&quot; Javascript features under chromium version 108. V11 will require users who rely on the electron client to uninstall and reinstall the client to receive this electron update.  </p>

        <li>Package manifests now support <code>relationships.recommends</code>, which can be used for declaring non-mandatory dependencies. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8649" target="_blank">(8649)</a></li>
        <li>Manifests may now declare <code>RelatedPackage.reason</code>, it is intended that developers use this field to offer a human-readable reason for specific package relationships and will be displayed on parts of the package installation and management UI. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8650" target="_blank">(8650)</a></li>
        <li>Package-related warnings and notifications are now displayed on the new Support & Issues tab. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8663" target="_blank">(8663)</a></li>

        <li>The <code>path</code> field can now be omitted from Package manifest compendium declarations, if omitted it will be assumed the packs reside in <code>package-id/packs/</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8741" target="_blank">(8741)</a></li>
    </ul>
