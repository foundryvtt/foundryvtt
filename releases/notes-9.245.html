</figure>

<p>Hello Foundry Virtual Tabletop community! We are pleased to release an update for Version 9 Stable Patch 2 (Build 245)! This update focuses on knocking down bugs discovered after the stable release, making minor adjustments to the UI to improve consistency, and introducing a myriad of small fixes to the API and its documentation to make sure that our community developers are having as smooth a time as possible.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> While this is categorized as a stable release there is always a possibility of unexpected bugs or compatibility issues. As with any time you update the core software, be sure to perform a complete backup of your user data to minimize any risk of data loss (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmbxMmqNNXU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Follow this handy guide</a>). </p>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>
<p>The vast majority of these changes are non-controversial, and the most notable of them in the update are as follows: 
</p><ul>
    <li>We improved the appearance of the module management and setup lists, introducing smaller tag icons and improved formatting to accommodate modules with long titles and large numbers of tags.</li>
    <li>We corrected a number of edge-case issues with vision, lighting and canvas rendering, knocking out a few more rare cases where vision would be weird or inaccurate.</li>
    <li>We have resolved a number of API documentation issues, improving quality of information for our community developers. </li>
</ul> 

<p>For a comprehensive list of everything we fixed, see below! </p>

<h2 class="border">Bug Fixes</h2>
    <h3>Documents and Data</h3>
    <ul>

We improved the semantics of available <code>FilePicker</code> types by adding a new <code>any</code> type which is now the default if no type is provided and accepts any supported file extension for upload. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6386" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6386</a>)</li>

        <li>Ensured that updating a token's sight with a macro will automatically display the new vision settings on the canvas. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6389" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6389</a>)</li>
        <li>Saved fog will no longer override a specified unexplored fog color. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6415" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6415</a>)</li>
        <li>Updated the torch lighting effect to be less intense on high frame rate displays. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6430" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6430</a>)</li>
        <li>Fixed polygon drawing tool so that it is possible to place more than two segments again. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6465" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6465</a>)</li>

        <li>Corrected unwanted behavior where <code>Canvas#_onDragLeftStart</code> checks active layer by exact constructor name. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6562" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6562</a>)</li>
        <li>Ensured that <code>MeasuredTemplate</code> is properly redrawn if the type is changed. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6593" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6593</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Dice and Cards</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Fixes an issue where imported card decks would incorrectly import their children cards, which resulted in orphaned cards. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6364" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6364</a>)</li>
    <li>Removed the ability to deal cards from a deck embedded in a compendium. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6470" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6470</a>)</li>

        <li>Adjusted formatting and styles of the module management window to improve the display of modules with multiple tags and long titles. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6422" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6422</a>)</li>
        <li>Expanding module descriptions will no longer ignore filters when managing modules. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6427" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6427</a>)</li>
        <li>Ensured that dropdown menus and certain dialog boxes would display properly on Firefox with Dark mode enabled. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6461" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6461</a>)</li>

        <li>Fixed <code>CONFIG.fontFamilies</code> to include fonts which are universally loaded into all web browsers. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6516" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6516</a>)</li>
        <li>Moved a misplaced arrow icon out of the guns folder in the foundry core icons library. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6580" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6580</a>)</li>
