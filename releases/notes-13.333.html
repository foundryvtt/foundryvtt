<section id="update-overview">
    <p>Hello Foundry community! We are extremely excited to release our second Prototype build in the Version 13 update cycle, Version 13.333... (repeating, of course!). Our focus was to refine and expand upon the first Prototype release by continuing to front-load the more serious changes to the API.</p>
    <p>In addition to the ongoing ruler work to support our community-selected feature (Token Drag Ruler) and the ongoing <code>ApplicationV2</code> convert-a-palooza, we've also added a slew of improvements throughout the application that we are quite excited to share with all of you today.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Updates on the Prototype channel provide the implementation of major new features which are likely to introduce unforeseen bugs, breakages to existing game systems or modules, or other problems which will be disruptive to the usage of the software. Do not install this update unless you are doing so for the specific purposes of testing, it is not intended for use in 'live game' scenarios. The purpose of Prototype builds are to allow new experimental features to be tested and to help developers to begin the process of updating packages which are impacted by these changes. If you choose to update to this version you expose yourself to serious risk of having a bad experience. Please take this warning to heart.</p>

    <h2 class="border">Highlights</h2>
    <h4>Making it Shiny</h4>
    <p>A primary focus for V13 is delivering the next generation of the Foundry user interface, and Prototype 2 provides strong progress in that initiative.</p>
    <p>This release implements a flexible CSS theming system, powering a Foundry light mode and dark mode as well as enabling other arbitrary themes. We can't wait to see what the Foundry community does with this functionality in Game Systems and Modules.</p>
    <p>Of course, many more important components of the Foundry UI have now also been migrated to Application V2 as well, bringing its visual and architectural improvements to an ever-increasing percentage of the software.</p>

    <h4>Foundry Rules!</h4>
    <p>To implement the Token Drag ruler as we envision, we continue to extensively improve the underlying movement-related data structures and API.</p>
    <p>With much of that work now in place, Prototype 2 delivers significant improvements in multi-waypoint movement, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Movement that would be blocked by a wall is indicated by a dashed line</li>
        <li>Auto-rotation of token facing as your Token moves about the map  (don't worry pog fans, you can lock rotation as usual to prevent this)</li>
        <li>Token movement speeds are now configurable for each waypoint segment</li>
        <li>Better interaction with Scene Regions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Measuring with <span class="reference">CTRL</span> also received some love in this release. You can now secretly measure a distance by holding <span class="reference">ALT</span> so that you don't tip your cunning plan to your unsuspecting players.</p>

    <h4>Unleash Your Token's Inner Darkness</h4>
    <p>Tokens have long been able to emit light, but now you can do the exact opposite and emit darkness as well. Your players will never see that monster coming...</p>

    <h4>Flashy Chat</h4>
    <p>Ever miss an incoming chat message because you were on a different sidebar tab? In Prototype 2, new incoming chat message notifications flash to the left of the sidebar to let you easily keep an eye on things.</p>
   
    <h4>Time for a Change</h4>
    <p>It is still a work in progress, but this release brings the beginnings of a prototype Calendar API for supporting configurable in-world calendars with the <code>GameTime</code> class.</p>

    <h3 class="border">Known Issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When entering or exiting a Scene Region. a token may sometimes "slide" along its boundary in certain cases. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/11868" target="_blank">(11868)</a></li>
        <li>Tokens may clip through walls during movement in certain circumstances. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/11869" target="_blank">(11869)</a></li>
