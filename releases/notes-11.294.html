<section id="update-overview">
    <p class="note warning"> Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>
    <p>Our previous Prototype 2 release concluded the Prototype phase of our <a href="/article/versioning" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Learn about our development cycle">development cycle</a>. Our focus during the API Development phase involves further refining prototype features and solidifying the API based on feedback from users in our Developer community. If you are a Module or System developer, now is the time to begin testing your packages in Version 11 in order to provide us with feedback and request any API changes that would make your lives easier.</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Updates on the Development channel are intended for testing and feedback from the development community. While the features and improvements of these updates may be close to a level of stability intended for public testing, they are likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. It is not intended to use these releases for a live game.</p>

    <h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>
    <h3>Tuning the Canvas for Higher Performance</h3>
    <p>Performance improvements are always on the menu and Atropos and SecretFire have cooked up a number of great improvements for developers and users. Developers get access to <code>PointSource</code>'s elevation levels, improved depth mapping precision, a brand new asset loader courtesy of PIXI's latest version, and the ability to override things like the <code>background</code>, <code>foreground</code>, and <code>fogOverlay</code> of a Scene during initialization. Our non-developer users on the other hand can look forward to performance improvements thanks to a new culling system and general improvements to the efficiency of some common rendering methods.</p>

    <h3>Synthetic Updates, Real Improvements</h3>
    <p>The work on synthetic token Actors in this release builds on the foundation that was laid in the previous release. Tokens now contain an internal <code>ActorDelta</code> child that behaves as a full embedded Document and can be updated in isolation. The <code>ActorDelta</code> now also contains a special type of collection, the <code>EmbeddedCollectionDelta</code> with bespoke logic to copy only those embedded children from the base Actor that are modified by the token Actor, significantly improving on the old behavior where the entire collection would be copied if any change was made. These changes have fixed some long-standing issues with synthetic token Actors (detailed below), with more on the way next release.</p>

    <h3>Some Like It Hot Reloaded</h3>
    <p>Another welcome addition that is sure to make developers happy is core support for Hot Reloading. Cody has added the ability to allow Foundry VTT to capture changes to certain files in realtime without having to reload the page. Now changes to your HTML and HBS, JSON used for localization, and CSS files can be seen right away. For those times when you do need to reload we have also improved loading speeds in most circumstances by enabling websocket compression by default. This is changeable using the <code>compressSocket</code> configuration option.</p>

    <h3>Coming Soon: Setup Theme Customization</h3>
    <p>This work didn't make it into Developer 1 but for Developer 2 we will introduce support for customizing the theme on the Setup page to ensure that everyone can make their Setup screen as unique as their game. You can keep an eye on the following issues to stay up to date: <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">9018</a> and <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9019" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">9019</a>.</p>

    <strong>Known Issues</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>There is occasionally a small flicker when moving certain placeables.</li>
        <li>There is occasionally an issue with drag+drop interactions for the Drawing tools.</li>

        <li>Hover events are now prevented on preview objects. This fixes a problem for Tokens where <span class="reference">T</span> for target during a Token drag operation would incorrectly attempt to target the preview Token. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9028" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9028)</a></li>
        <li>The <code>createPolygonWithAttenuatedThreshold</code> method now uses <code>this</code> instead of selecting the polygon class from <code>polygonBackends</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9042" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9042)</a></li>
        <li>Improved the inference around expected directional Token movement when the Token isn't snapped to a grid position. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9061" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9061)</a></li>
        <li>The <code>WeilerAthertonClipper.combine</code> method now passes <code>clipOpts</code> to <code>WeilerAthertonClipper.testForEnvelopment</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9074" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9074)</a></li>
        <li>The <code>PointSourcePolygon#isCompleteCircle</code> method no longer fails if the <code>config</code> doesn't have a <code>source</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9075" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9075)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="category-header" id="bugs-packages">Package Development</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue that prevented locking Worlds, Systems, or Modules that were not compatible with the current version of Foundry. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9004" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9004)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="category-header" id="bugs-i18n">Localization and Accessibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Removed a duplicate "." in <code>SETUP.InstallFailure</code> which caused a localization error. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9007" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9007)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="category-header" id="bugs-other">Other Changes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>World settings of type <code>Array</code> no longer return a nested array. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8765" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(8765)</a></li>
        <li>Settings are now cast to their configured data type as part of the initialization workflow. This allows the cast value to always be passed to the <code>onChange</code> handler instead of the raw string. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8908" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(8908)</a></li>
        <li>The texture loader should no longer reload a texture if the previous call to <code>loadTexture</code> of the same resource wasn't awaited. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8909" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(8909)</a></li>
