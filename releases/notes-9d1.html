    <figcaption>Welcome to the Foundry Virtual Tabletop update notes for Version 9 Development 1.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Hello everyone, we are excited to share our continued progress on Foundry Virtual Tabletop Version 9 with this "Development 1" release that brings API and functionality improvements based on testing feedback from our first two V9 prototype releases.</p>

<p>The major features of Foundry Virtual Tabletop V9 are the new Adaptive Lighting system and Card Support. In this release we have improvements and bug fixes for both new features that continue progressing them towards a stable release. In addition to these main themes we have added a few new features including a redesign of the Scene Configuration application, an improved interface for game invitation links that allows you to test your connection, and overall UX improvements to our main setup menu.</p>

<p>With this release we would like to put a call out to the wider development community: now is the time to get feedback to us about API improvements. If there is something which you have had to use workaround code to accomplish which could be better handled with some API changes within Foundry VTT, we want to hear from you. After the next development release, we anticipate moving onto the Feature Testing phase, which will see our API closed for this Version. Thanks to those of you whom have provided feedback on V9 so far. We appreciate your assistance with testing and your engagement during the development process.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Updates on the Development channel are intended for testing and feedback from the development community. While the features and improvements of these updates may be close to a level of stability intended for public testing, they are likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. It is not intended to use these releases for a live game.</p>
<p class="note warning">Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>
<h2 class="border">Known Issues</h2>
<p>Due to an issue introduced in the prototyping phase, updating to this build from an earlier release of V9 will require a full reinstallation rather than use of the update menu. This issue persists in V9d1, but will be corrected in V9d2.</p>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>

<p>Though V9d1 was primarily an update centering around improving the API for our community developers while introducing UI and UX feature cleanup for new features introduced during the prototype phase, we also took the time to address some lingering bugs and bring in some key UX/UI features requested by our awesome userbase.</p>
<h4>Cards UI and API</h4>
<p>As we advance from the prototype phase into the API development phase, we have continued to work on Card Support and and heard feedback from the community about what API functions might be missing from the initial Card Support implementation. This update brings support for drag and drop operations to the cards windows, improved permission controls for card collections, and some tidying of the UI for card management to bring some more standardization to the functions within them. We revisited the artwork for the default card deck images, and made some overall minor corrections to our approach including removal of excess padding around the images and replacement of the placeholder jack images with ones that were not just mirrored. Lastly, the Cards API functions now include ability to pass specific cards between decks, return a specific card to its parent, and perform bulk operations for passing a group of cards.</p>
<h4>Overall UX and UI</h4>
<p>In addition to some of the more specifically targetted changes in this release, we have also taken steps to improve the UI and UX for a number of the more commonly accessed configuration windows. The scene configuration window has had its UI simplified and broken down into a tabbed approach, a new configuration option allows for the text size to be adjusted for the entire application. We took advantage of some earlier work done on the CSS for our in-game UI to allow the sidebar to be layered over the rest of the screen in cases of smaller width monitors, and we corrected a small (but no less irritating) issue with the playlist UI where playing a track would cause the view to visually 'jump'. We also added a new, automatic obscuration of the remote invitation link to help save streamers from accidentally revealing their game invitation links. The setup menu also got a little touch up in the form of some label repositioning and while we were in there, we added ability to filter the view of your worlds, systems, and modules by text entry. </p>
<h4>Day of Deprecation</h4>
<p>The time foretold has come, fire rains from the skies and the earth trembles and quakes, for Entities have been removed from the Foundry VTT API, Data schema, and overall architecture. To put this more clearly, we have finished deprecating the use of Entities, and those remaining ones which slipped by the past deprecation (specifically related to compendium packs) have been given a longer deprecation path which is intended to end in V11. For those of the development community with modules or systems that still feature javascript calls to Entity or Entities, use of the new Documents structure is now mandatory for your code to continue working.</p>

<p>As always, this is just a brief summary of some of the items we wanted to highlight from within this release! Look forward to more in the forthcoming V9d2 and read the full update notes below.</p>
<div>
<h2 class="border">Breaking Changes</h2>

<h3>Architecture and Infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In continuing the deprecation of Entity declarations, we have begun deprecating the Entity field in compendium definitions in favour of a type field more common in our Document schema. The previous entity field will continue to be supported until v11 to allow for module and system authors to make the changes as above. Worlds will be migrated automatically and do not require any user action. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5992" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5992</a>)</li>
</ul>

<div>
<h2 class="border">New Features</h2>
    <h3>Architecture and Infrastructure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chat.db has been migrated to messages.db in order to match with the naming schema for Documents. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5016" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5016</a>)</li>
        <li>When browsing packages that can be installed or checking for package updates only a single request will be sent to the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com" rel="nofollow">https://foundryvtt.com</a>, avoiding an issue that could result in multiple simultaneous requests. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5883" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5883</a>)</li>
        <li>Updated Electron wrapper to 14.1.1 including the LetsEncrypt root certificate fix. It will be necessary to perform a fresh install of Foundry VTT to receive this update (only applies to users running the Electron Self-Hosted Application, not to node users with dedicate servers.) (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5993" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5993</a>)</li>

        <li><code>Cards#dealDialog</code>, <code>Cards#passDialog</code>, and <code>Cards#drawDialog</code> now provide warning notifications for cases where no valid source or target cards documents are present to support the operation, for example: in cases where a deck is empty or a pile is not present. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5904" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5904</a>)</li>
        <li><code>Cards#pass</code> has been implemented, allowing for transferring a specific list of embedded Card documents (by id) to another Cards pile. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5924" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5924</a>)</li>
        <li>It is now possible to pass one or more Cards back to a parent Deck via <code>Card#pass</code> or <code>Cards#pass</code>, doing so will unset the drawn attribute for that card. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5994</a>)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>The Game Canvas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Ruler#moveToken</code> has had its efficiency improved and now retrieves the existing animation for Token movement, awaiting its completion rather than dispatching a redundant animation request.
