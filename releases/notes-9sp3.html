<h2 class="border">New Features</h2>
    <h3>Architecture and Infrastructure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Log files now also indicate which build number of the software is running, not just the Version number. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6620" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6620</a>)</li>
        <li>An upstream update to <code>pixi/graphics-smooth</code> has been included which fixes an issue with small transparent pixel artifacts in freehand Drawings. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6729" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6729</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Game Canvas</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>The torch preset animation for Ambient Light sources has had its amplitude increased and is now properly halted when its speed is set to 0. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6624" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6624</a>)</li>
