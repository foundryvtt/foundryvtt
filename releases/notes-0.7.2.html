	<figcaption>Welcome to the Foundry Virtual Tabletop update notes for Alpha version 0.7.1.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is the third update in the feature-rich 0.7.x sequence of updates in the "alpha" (<strong>unstable</strong>) channel which is available to all Foundry Virtual Tabletop owners.</p>
	
<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Alpha channel releases are <strong>VERY LIKELY</strong> to introduce breaking bugs that will be disruptive to play. Do not install this update unless you are using for the specific purposes of testing. The intention of Alpha builds are to allow for previewing new features and to help developers to begin updating modules which are impacted by the changes. If you choose to update to this version for a live game you do so entirely at your own risk of having a bad experience.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Please back up your critical user data before installing this update.</strong></p>

<p>I am very happy to be able to share these features with you all, and I am looking forward to continuing work on this series of updates as it moves towards a stable release.</p>

	<li>Assign Token button will now correctly clear flags.	</li>
	<li>formData once again has a standardized depth of object.	</li>
	<li>Left-clicking an entity in a compendium pack was unaware that an existing sheet for that entity may already be rendered, resulting in it being possible to repeatedly open copies of the same entity.	</li>
	<li>Corrected an issue where inputting the inverse number of a current HP value would fail to calculate correctly.	</li>
	<li>Item Sheets are not properly uniquely identified, making it possible to open multiple sheets of the same item.	</li>
	<li>The Import All Content option for a compendium pack will no longer fail for Macros or Playlists.	</li>

<h3>Framework and API Changes</h3>

<h4>Active Effects</h4>
<p>Implemented part 2 of the ActiveEffects Phase 1 system with an EmbeddedEntity in the Item model which can be applied to Actors either by owner, or by target.</p>
<ul>
<li>[BREAKING] Added new ActiveEffect application mode options for UPGRADE and DOWNGRADE, and re-organized the default ordering of ActiveEffect modes.	</li>
<li>[BREAKING] Renamed the "data" field in the ActiveEffect data model to "changes" to be more specific about the nature of effect data.	</li>
<li>[BREAKING] Refactored the ActiveEffect model to target changes at the Actor level, rather then in the system data object specifically. This allows for Active effects to temporarily change base actor attributes like token attributes, image, or flags.	</li>
<li>[BREAKING] Moved the methods which are responsible for applying an ActiveEffect to a given Actor into the ActiveEffect class instead of the Actor class.	</li>
<li>When an active effect is applied with mode ADD to a field which does not have any current value, it will impute the current value as zero and add from there.	</li>
<li>Improved the way that entityClass overrides are handled in each EntityCollection to ensure that overridden instances of the base entity types are applied consistently throughout.	</li>
<li>When adding an Item to an Actor, the UUID of the source item will now be included in the data so that the origin of the item data can be tracked and updated.	</li>
<li>Configured ActiveEffects on OwnedItems to Automatically delete ActiveEffects from an Actor when the OwnedItem that provided them is deleted.</li>
<li>Added a "disabled" property to each ActiveEffect which allows it to be toggled off and on without being removed from the Actor that owns it.	</li>
<li>The class definition used for ActiveEffect instances can now be configured under CONFIG.ActiveEffect.entityClass.	</li>
<li>ActiveEffect embedded entities which exist on an Item can be either transferred to an Actor when that Item becomes an Owned Item, or can remain as part of the Owned Item data model.	</li>
<li>Added convenience APIs for updating or deleting an ActiveEffect from the embedded entity instance directly.	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Audio / Video Chat Integration</h4>
<ul>
	<li>[BREAKING] Refactored the WebRTC family of classes to be general AV (AVMaster, AVClient, etc...) classes which do not strictly require all interfaces to use the WebRTC protocol.	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Entities</h4>
<ul>
	<li>[BREAKING] Provided a new general-purpose Entity#hasPlayerOwner attribute to test whether any non-gamemaster user has ownership permission to the Entity instance. Deprecated the Actor#isPC attribute in favor of this more general approach.	</li>
	<li>[BREAKING] Refactored the User Management screen to implement more standardized client/server handling workflows rather than using a specialized POST request.	</li>
	<li>[BREAKING] Concluded deprecation of loading Application options by class name from the CONFIG object.	</li>
	<li>Removed the requirement for an EmbeddedDocument to define an explicit parent Document type in its metadata.	</li>
	<li>Standardized the return for `ActorTokenHelpers.createEmbeddedEntity()` and `Entity.createEmbeddedEntity()`.	</li>
	<li>Added support for passing the recursive {boolean} flag to Entity and Embedded Entity update operations to specify that certain objects being updated should not be merged recursively.	</li>
	<li>Added an optional key to the BaseEntitySheet which allows subclasses to define the permission level from ENTITY_PERMISSIONS that would allow a player to view the app.	</li>
	<li>Database preSave and postSave operations can now access the Options object that was provided as part of the CRUD workflow.	</li>
	<li>Simplified the OwnedItem database schema to inherit and simplify the schema from the base Item entity.	</li>
	<li>Added system name (id) as a class to the BODY element.	</li>
	<li>Whitespace  will now Automatically be trimmed from form fields which are set as data-dtype="String".	</li>
	<li>Added support for a new recursive option in the mergeObject helper method which allows for inner objects to be merged recursively (by default) or directly replaced with the provided new value (if false).	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Canvas, Lighting, and Scenes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>[BREAKING] Deprecated support for @[name] <message> for whispers since it collides and causes confusion with dynamic entity links. Now only /w [name] <message> is the supported slash command syntax for chat message whispers.	</li>
	<li>[BREAKING] Added the ability to keep the same Combat turn when calling Combat#rollInitiative to allow for a use case where it's necessary to reset the initiative order at the start of a new round.	</li>
	<li>Improved the sight polygon computation algorithm to perform an exact computation when there are a low number of Wall endpoints (configurable, default 500) in the Scene. The computation algorithm will only use approximate culling-based computation method for higher count Scenes.	</li>
	<li>Further refined the vision computation algorithm to prioritize exact Ray matches (at Wall endpoints) over approximate offset matches. This maximizes the number of exact collisions which can occur.	</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Other API Changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>[BREAKING] Deprecated support for <code>@[name] &lt;message&gt;</code> for whispers since it collides and causes confusion with dynamic entity links. Now only /w [name] <message> is the supported slash command syntax for chat message whispers.	</li>
	<li>[BREAKING] Added the ability to keep the same Combat turn when calling Combat#rollInitiative to allow for a use case where it's necessary to reset the initiative order at the start of a new round.	</li>
	<li>The get permission getter for Chat Messages now incorporates message authorship as defining the permission level of the message Entity.	</li>
	<li>Removed the requirement that a Combatant must reference a valid Token ID.	</li>
	<li>pasteObjects on PlaceableLayer and WallLayer instances now return an Array with the created objects data including the ID of the newly created entities.	</li>
	<li>Add support for a snap option in the PlaceablesLayer#pasteObjects method which is true by default but can be overridden via the API or by holding the SHIFT key when pasting data.</li>
	<li>Created a new TextFilter UI helper class for all cases where a text input field is used to filter the set of results which are displayed within an application view.	</li>
	<li>The content of the awsConfig file will now be validated in addition to simple existence of the JSON file to test that the provided configuration values will succeed in establishing a connection.	</li>
	<li>Added support for providing a subset of configuration options in the awsConfig JSON file which can still be used even if not all elements of the object are provided.	</li>
	<li>Added the updateWorldTime hook to allow systems and modules to respond when the official World time is changed.	</li>
	<li>Added uptime to /api/status endpoint to report how long the server has been running a world for.	</li>	
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3>Documentation Improvements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The 0.7.1 update includes many significant documentation improvements for the API documentation including more accurate typing information for a large number of parameters and more complete documentation for certain classes which were lacking.</li>
	<li>Please note - this improved documentation is <strong>NOT YET</strong> available on the Foundry website as the current API documentation refers to the latest release build. I will try to consider ways to make alpha channel API documentation available as well but I have not yet developed a solution for this.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There are no specific known issues at this time - but this is an alpha build - so it is known that there are issues (potentially serious ones). Proceed with caution.</li>
</ul>
