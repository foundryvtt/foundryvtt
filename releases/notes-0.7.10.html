<p>Hello everyone! I am very satisfied to release Foundry Virtual Tabletop version 0.7.10, the final stable release in the 0.7.x series of updates. This update focuses on resolving and fixing a few remaining bugs that have lingered since 0.7.9, providing a path for migration to 0.8.x for smooth upgrades for those running their servers using Node 14+ already, and bringing our final inclusions in the icon library back for those users who might wish to remain on 0.7.x for a while longer. As the closing version for 0.7.x, no further features or changes will be brought to 0.7.x as we look toward the future by supporting the 0.8.x stable branch and working toward the exciting features yet to come in 0.9.x.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> WARNING: Version 0.7.10 is labeled as a stable release, but there is always the possibility of unexpected bugs or module compatibility issues. We do not recommend updating immediately prior to a game session unless you are confident in your own ability to troubleshoot any issues that arise.</p>

<h3 class="border">Update Overview</h3>

<p>As the final stable release for 0.7.x this update primarily focused on some minor bug fixes. As such, the only new feature is the addition of more than 1500 icons that were previously only available to the 0.8.x version.</p>


<h3 class="border">New Features</h3>
<h4>Interface and Applications</h4>
<ul>
	<li>More than 1500 new icons have been added, the majority of which are "action" oriented, depicting skills, abilities, and magic spells!</li>
    <li>The software update function now performs a node.js version check as part of the update process, allowing individuals using node to host the server to upgrade directly to 0.8.x if Node 14+ is detected.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="border">API Improvements</h3>
<h4>Documents and Data</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Macro execution is now wrapped in an async scope, which allows the use of await within script macros.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="border">Bug Fixes</h3>
<h4>Infrastructure and Architecture</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Added some security fixes discovered while working on 0.8.x which were suitable for backporting.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Documents and Data</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Actors and items imported from compendia will no longer be incorrectly created using derived data, and now use the correct base data structure instead.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Game Canvas</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Token disposition color will now be displayed correctly based on set disposition, instead of assuming every token is neutral.</li>
</ul>
