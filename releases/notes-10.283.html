    <h2 class="border">Update Overview</h2>
    <p>At long last we are proud and excited to announce the first build in the stable release branch of Version 10! This is, without a doubt, our largest stable release yet and in completing it we have completed nearly 1000 separate feature improvements and bug fixes over the course of its development. This release is the culmination of thousands of hours of development time, with work having begun as early as January 2022, and we are extremely proud to be able to bring its features to our community. V10's development focused on several key aspects of the software, including a complete renovation of our Journals system (bringing a new editor, collaborative editing, new supported journal types and more), drastic changes to the way Token Vision works (including the new Sight and Detection Modes system), the finalization of the Adventure Document framework, the groundwork for our Tours and Tooltips UI improvements to help guide new users, and so much more!</p>
    <p>As always, we caution our users to be careful when updating to a brand new stable build, as many game systems and add-on modules will not be updated to support the latest version just yet. If your game relies on a lot of modules or you aren't certain about whether your system supports it, a small measure of patience now can save you some headaches as a result of incompatibilities. Be sure, as always, to back up your userdata.</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> While this is categorized as a stable release there is always a possibility of unexpected bugs or compatibility issues. As with any time you update the core software, be sure to perform a complete backup of your user data to minimize any risk of data loss.</p>

	<h2 class="section-header border">Update Highlights</h2>
    <p>It has been a long and rewarding road as we have worked on V10, and we've managed to pack every inch of it with new features and improvements. Not only have we improved performance in a lot of ways, we have introduced sweeping changes to Journal Entries, Tours to help new users acclimatize to the software, improvements to the UX and UI across the board, new Vision and Detection modes for Tokens, and so much more. There is such a variety of new functionality that we've decided to break it down into individual categories to help you find the information that most interests you:  </p>

        <header class="collapsible-header">Journal Entries and Pages</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>As the winner of the community patreon prioritization vote, V10 focused heavily on improving the Journal Entry system. We have completely refactored Journals to be more intuitive and easier to use, and we have introduced a facet of Journals called Pages. Any single Journal entry is now composed of multiple Pages, and each page can provide a different type of content, with user permissions managed independently of the parent journal entry. The Journal UI has received a complete overhaul, and now includes a sidebar providing a table of contents, presenting each page that has been created as well as clickable links to the headers within a text page. In addition to all these cool features, we want to especially highlight:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We have introduced the new ProseMirror text editor, which replaces TinyMCE for rich-text fields, offering improvements to the overall editing experience.</li>
                <li>Journal Entries now support Markdown formatting, allowing users to create rich text content using the simple Markdown syntax common in many text editing and chat programs.</li>
                <li>We often hear requests to add a way to allow multiple users to edit the same Journal without overwriting each others changes. The new ProseMirror editor implementation allows collaborative editing for text pages, and users can see changes in realtime as the document is updated by others. Please note that raw HTML editing does not function with collaborative editing due to limitations of that editing process specifically.</li>
                <li>It is now possible to embed PDFs and Videos as new page types, allowing you to easily view particular reference documents or provide video clips (including YouTube) embedded for your players to see.</li>

        <header class="collapsible-header">Token Vision and Detection Modes</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>The first iteration of a robust framework, we are proud to announce the addition of Token Vision and Detection Modes, both of which allows users and developers alike the ability to alter how vision appears and functions for Tokens. Available for configuration from the Vision Tab, Vision Modes alter how the token's vision <strong>appears</strong>, while Detection Modes change the <strong>mechanical functions</strong> of what the token can see. A token may only have one Vision Mode, but may have numerous Detection Modes. </p>
            <p>Foundry VTT offers native support for the following, implemented in a system-agnostic way, with the expectation that game systems will alter their behavior to match the rules of particular games.</p>
            <h3>Vision Modes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Vision - The standard, default vision mode appearance.</li>
                <li>Darkvision - In areas where no light source exists, vision is desaturated and does not display color. Areas which contain light sources show colors as expected.</li>
                <li>Monochromatic - Similar to darkvision, but regardless of light source, this token will not be able to see colors.</li>
                <li>Tremorsense - A visual effect similar to a radar sweep, which pulses and visually obscures the scene's background but preserves details such as fog exploration and wall placement.</li>
                <li>Light Amplification - A visual effect similar to night-vision goggles.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Detection Modes</h3>
            <p>Detection modes that begin with "See" require line of sight and will not reveal objects behind walls, while ones beginning with "Sense" do not require line of sight and will pierce walls to reveal what is behind them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Sight - Used to override the default basic sight settings.</li>
                <li>See Invisibility - Allows a token to see other tokens that have been set with the "Invisible" condition.</li>
                <li>Sense Invisibility - Allows the token to see other tokens that have been set with the "Invisible" condition regardless of walls. </li>
                <li>Feel Tremor - allows the token to sense all other tokens at their elevation. Tokens which have an elevation greater than the scene's height are presumed to be floating or flying and will not appear on this token's vision.</li>
                <li>See All - Allows the token to see all other tokens regardless of available light.</li>
                <li>Sense All - Allows the token to see all other tokens regardless of available light, regardless of the presence of walls.</li>
            </ul>

        <header class="collapsible-header">Overall User Experience Improvements</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>As part of a larger, multi-update effort to improve the overall user experience of Foundry Virtual Tabletop, we have made a number of changes to the software that will make it easier to use and more intuitive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We have implemented new ways for users to get the ID of a Document, simply by clicking on a button next to the document's name in an application header, making it much more convenient for users to reference a specific document by ID in macro use or otherwise.</li>
                <li>Creating any new document will now automatically populate the name field if it is left blank, making it easier and quicker to create multiple new documents, and we have improved that workflow by reducing the overall required number of clicks to create new documents.</li>
                <li>We have completely refactored the way the Game Settings window is displayed, providing a new appearance more in line with the rest of the software, and making it easier to use.</li>
                <li>The Journal Notes layer now has a simple indicator which shows users whether or not any notes are visible to them on the scene.</li>
                <li>Measured templates, ambient lights, and ambient sounds have been improved to have feature parity with one another. It is now possible to toggle the visibility of all of these on and off with a simple right-click, their preview functions when making changes within their configurations are more consistent, and resizing a measured template no longer causes its highlighted squares to differ from its original creation.</li>
                <li>We now provide ability for users to define different custom fonts on a per-World basis. When uploaded and configured, fonts will appear in all font dropdown menus, including text drawings, Map Notes, and rich text editors.</li>
                <li>Uploading of Base64 images (whether via copy-pasting or directly dragging from your desktop) now coerces those files into specific saved images, rather than attempting to store a Base64 string. This saves on performance issues and data corruption which could result from trying to store strings too long to fit within our database engine.</li>
                <li>Searching for a World, Game System, or Add-on Module will now offer a link to search the package repository if no results are found in currently installed packages.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="collapsible">
        <header class="collapsible-header">Tooltips and Tours</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content"><p>As part of our efforts to improve the experience of using Foundry VTT for new users, we have introduced two new frameworks for providing users with contextual information about the software. The first is a new Tooltip system, which replaces the previous on-hover behaviour, giving users a simple, clean, and more uniform tooltip containing information whenever on-screen elements are hovered over. The second is a new Tour system, which provides guided tours of key aspects of the software, including the highlighting specific elements and providing information about them. Both of these systems are available to developers to use in their own modules, and we have already begun to use them in the core software to provide users with more information about the software.</p>
        <p>The following Tours are included as part of the software at this time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Welcome to Foundry Virtual Tabletop - A basic introduction to the core concepts of Foundry VTT for new users.</li>
            <li>Installing a System - An introduction for new users which steps through the process of downloading a game system.</li>
            <li>Creating a World - A tour of the process of creating a new World, including the various configuration options available.</li>
            <li>UI Overview - An introduction to the differing parts of the the UI for new users.</li>
            <li>The Sidebar - A simple introduction to the different sidebar tabs and using them to create and manage your Documents.</li>
            <li>Canvas Controls - A quick introduction to the Canvas controls and what the buttons for each layer actually do.</li>

        <header class="collapsible-header">Audio/Video Chat UI</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>We wanted to provide a UI for Audio/Video Chat Integration which would be more in line with the overall appearance of the Foundry VTT software, so we gave the appearance a new coat of paint and a few new features. A/V Chat Integration now includes a dock on the left-hand side of the screen by default which will contain frames of video (or a static avatar image) for each user. Each user's name will automatically cycle on a short timer between their username and the primary Actor they've been assigned (or "game master" for GM users with no assigned character). We've included options to move the dock to the top, bottom, or right of the screen, and options for replacing the default gradient with a gradient based on the user's assigned color instead. Also, the dock can be collapsed into a smaller form at any time to occupy less visual space.</p>

    <section class="collapsible">
        <header class="collapsible-header">Adventure Documents</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>Version 10 formally introduces the Adventure Document, a specific type of Document which can only be created within adventure compendiums and can be composed using every other type of Document. For those of you who have purchased the Demon Queen Awakens, the Pathfinder Beginner Box, or Abomination Vaults premium content modules, you may already be familiar with Adventure Documents. Adventure Documents were designed to make it easier for content creators to package their content for distribution as a single compendium which maintains all sorts of data including document IDs, dynamic links, token positions on scenes and much more. Adventure Documents make it easy to store all of the contents of a world in its present state, including a simple Adventure Builder utility that allows you to drag and drop specific documents or folders of documents from your world to include them.</p>

    <section class="collapsible">
        <header class="collapsible-header">Canvas Interaction Tools (Pings)</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>Something which had been a planned feature for quite some time, Foundry VTT now provides a simple and clean 'interaction' toolkit, allowing GMs and players to draw attention of users to a specific location on a scene. Not only does this support several types of pings, it also shows a display at the edge of the screen in the direction of the ping for users who might not be focused in the area at the time. These pings can be triggered while on the Tokens layer of the canvas only, and provide the following functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Ping creates a simple pulsing circle under your cursor and can be triggered by pressing-and-holding the left mouse button over any place on the scene.</li>
                <li>Warning pings create a pulsing red triangle under your cursor, and can be triggered by holding the ALT key while pressing-and-holding the left mouse button over any place on the scene.</li>
                <li>(GM Only) Drag pings force all users to view a specific place on the scene, dragging their view of the canvas to that point. They appear as a downward pointing arrow and are triggered by holding the Shift key while pressing-and-holding the left mouse button over any place on the scene.</li>
                <li>Combat Tracker Pings can be triggered by any user by clicking the 'ping combatant' button on any combatant in the combat tracker.</li>

            <header class="collapsible-header">API Improvements, DocumentData Refactor, and Package Management Changes!</header>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>Through communication with our community developers we found a number of areas where the Foundry VTT API could be improved, including new migration functions, a variety of new Hooks, and extension of API functionality into the new features we have introduced. In addition, we launched a very thorough refactoring of the architecture used for storing Document Data. This refactor empowers us (and our community developers) to do a much better job handling complex data structures and is expected to be a cornerstone for the Foundry VTT Document architecture for years to come.</p>
                <p>In addition, we extended some quality of life improvements for community developers which offer more granular definition of compatibility with the core software, as well as ability to define relationships to other packages other than simple dependencies.</p>
