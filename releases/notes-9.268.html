<p>We are very pleased to bring you all another bug-fixing focused update with Version 9 Stable Build 268. As with all releases on the Stable branch, this build is composed of fixes and changes for bugs sourced from feedback provided by you, our awesome community, as well as internal testing. These updates prioritize resolving bugs in ways which will not introduce breaking changes to the API or negatively impact modules and game systems.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> While this is categorized as a stable release there is always a possibility of unexpected bugs or compatibility issues. As with any time you update the core software, be sure to perform a complete backup of your user data to minimize any risk of data loss (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmbxMmqNNXU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Follow this handy guide</a>).</p>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>

<p>Our goal for this release was to polish up a few lingering non-critical (but no less irritating) bugs to help keep V9 stable while our development focus is spent primarily on Version 10. This is a fairly light update, surgically targeting a few UI and API issues as well as a few lingering bugs that couldn't be addressed during our last update. We also took the opportunity to address a few UI and documentation inconsistencies.</p>
