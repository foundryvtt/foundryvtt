<section id="update-overview">
    <p>Since the arrival of Version 13 Stable in late April, we've released a steady series of minor patches to help refine it. In that vein, Version 13 Stable 5 contains a collection of important but relatively undramatic improvements and bugfixes.</p>  
    <p>Notably, we anticipate that today's release will be the last (or one of the last) of these "patch" releases. As proud as we are of Version 13, we are extremely eager to turn our full attention to the next major generation of Foundry VTT.</p>
    <p>Both the Patreon poll winner (<a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/v14-patreon-vote/#pop-out-application-windows" rel="nofollow">core "pop out" application windows</a>) and "Scene Levels" (enhanced verticality for Scenes) are features that have long been eagerly anticipated by Foundry VTT staff and users alike. With work starting in earnest on Version 14 soon, these features begin to become reality. Stay tuned!</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> While this is categorized as a stable release there is always a possibility of unexpected bugs or compatibility issues. As with any time you update the core software, be sure to perform a complete backup of your user data to minimize any risk of data loss.</p>

<section id="update-highlights">
    <p>While this release makes modest changes, there are two items that we would like to call some additional attention to.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>The new pre-made <code>assets</code> folder <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/12897" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(12897)</a></dt>
        <dd>One change that Version 13 brought was preventing users from uploading files into existing locations that weren't great places to store user data safely. To help make uploading files more intuitive for users who are new to this change, we now automatically create a folder named <code>assets</code> in your Foundry User Data location if it doesn't already exist. Files can be safely uploaded into this location, or you can create your own folder if you wish as usual.</dd>
        <dt>Experimental non-QWERTY keyboard layout improvements <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/11047" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(11047)</a></dt>
        <dd>If you use an alternative keyboard layout, there is an experimental new Core Setting available named "Universal Keybindings (experimental)." If you use such a keyboard layout and want to help us to test this feature, please enable it and let us know your thoughts in our the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/1243227783082283140" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#v13-feedback</a> channel of our <a href="https://discord.gg/FoundryVTT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>.</dd>
