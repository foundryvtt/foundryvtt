</figure>
<p>Welcome to the second beta channel update in the Foundry Virtual Tabletop 0.8.x series! This update focuses on continued series of improvements that were the focus of 0.8.x, including a new audio engine for improved Playlists and audio functionality, improvements to the dice system, a brand new Overhead Tiles system, and a complete overhaul of data structures for the purposes of standardizing the API. The incorporation of another 1500 pieces of icon artwork available to all users, and a substantial number of user experience improvements, bug fixes, and API enhancements.</p>
<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Beta channel releases have the potential to introduce breaking bugs that may be disruptive to play. These features are close to ready for a stable release - but likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. If your game in particular relies upon a large number of add-on modules, it would be best to wait for the stable release.</p>
<p>If are upgrading the Foundry Virtual Tabletop <strong>application</strong> to 0.8.4 from 0.7.9 <strong>you must perform a fresh installation of the software</strong>. Because of some of the infrastructure changes it is only possible to update to this version from within the Foundry VTT application if you are already using 0.8.0. This does not apply to users running <strong>dedicated servers</strong> with Node 14+.</p>
<p>As always, before any significant update:</p>
<p class="note warning">Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>

<h3 class="border">Update Overview</h3>

<p>The 0.8.4 update primarily focused upon bringing bug fixes for some of the more prominent bugs that appeared during the 0.8.3 testing process, most of which were related to package management or document data. However, it also brings a couple of new features in to improve Overhead tile functionality. </p>
<p>0.8.4 adds the Radial Occlusion mode for Overhead Tiles, which allows for a small circular cutout around tokens passing below an Overhead Tile. In addition, if an Overhead tile is set to the Roof mode, weather effects on the scene will be masked, allowing the Roof tile to prevent weather from falling in the area below it.</p>

<h3 class="border">Known Issues</h3>
<p>Audio/Video Chat integration using the built-in EasyRTC server is currently non-functional. Other methods of Audio/Video chat such as Jitsi should not be impacted. We hope to have this issue resolved in the next release.</p>

<h3 class="border">Breaking Changes</h3>
<li>Following internal discussion, the change made to load order to which loaded script files after ESmodules has been reverted, and vanilla js scripts will now be loaded before ESmodules. This is a return to the load order used in 0.7.x to allow developers to more easily include dependency scripts.</li>
<li>The preCreate{DocumentName} hook is no longer incorrectly being provided with the expanded DocumentData as its second parameter rather than the initial data object provided to the Document creation request, as intended. For more information please see: https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5126
</li>

<h3 class="border">New Features</h3>
<h4>Architecture and Infrastructure</h4>
<ul>
    <li>To ensure that a migrated database file is maintained cleanly, <code>CompendiumCollection#migrate</code> now concludes with a forced database compaction.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Game Canvas</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Overhead Tiles now support a radial occlusion mode which fade away a portion of the overhead tile in radius around a controlled Token.</li>
    <li>Roof tiles now suppress the presence of weather effects when they are occluded by a controlled token beneath them.</li>
    <li>The progress reported for loading assets in when a scene is activated or pre-loaded should now be more specific, providing improved visual feedback for loading.</li>
    <li>When a player loads into a Scene where they have multiple owned tokens, the Scene will now initialize with all of those tokens controlled rather than only one of them.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Interface and Applications</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Modules and Game Systems that list a per-version manifest in the Admin Page are now able to be processed as a sidegrade.</li>
    <li>The "Update All" function in the Game Systems and Modules lists now provides a list of all packages that were updated or failed to update.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dice System</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Flavour text can now be applied to Parenthetical Dice Rolls, Math-based, and Dice Pool based dice rolls by attaching [Flavour text goes here] to the end of any of them. For example: (<code>/r min(2d4,3)[Fire damage] + 1d8[Bludgeoning Damage] + {2d10, 3d10}kh[Necrotic Damage] </code>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="border">API Improvements</h3>
<h4>Architecture and Infrastructure</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Updated package dependencies such as Electron, PixiJS, socket.io, aws-sdk, open-easyRTC and others to latest minor versions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Documents and Data</h4>
<ul>
    <li>As a result of changes made to Active Effect origins on owned items, a data migration function will now occur when items are detected with Active Effects that reference "OwnedItem" in their UUID.</li>
    <li>Propagating changes made to a base <code>Actor</code> document onward to unlinked <code>TokenDocument</code> instances which reference that Actor's data now uses the <code>TokenDocument</code> class for an improved workflow.</li>
    <li>Provide an option as part of the DocumentModificationContext that allows for document create operations to try and preserve an existing _id rather than forcibly discarding and re-generating it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Game Canvas</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A new <code>CachedContainer</code> has been implemented. This enables rendering the contents of a <code>PIXI.Container</code> to a screen-sized renderTexture each frame. For more information please see: https://foundryvtt.com/api/alpha/CachedContainer.html</li>
    <li>To allow all canvas blur filters to be synchronized when soft-shadows and zoom-level settings are changed, the logic for <code>BlurFilter</code> management in the canvas has been centralized with the <code>createBlurFilter</code> and <code>updateBlur</code> methods. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Interface and Applications</h4>
<ul>
    <li><code>_restoreScrollPositions()</code> should now be called after render hooks are fired to ensure restoration of the scroll position is correctly applied.</li>
    <li>General improvements have been made to module and system load order.</li>
