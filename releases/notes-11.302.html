    <p>Introducing Foundry VTT Version 11 (302), the next iteration in our stable release of V11. This update addresses a number of small, non-breaking feature requests and resolves a wide variety of bugs found in post-release use. This is a smaller update designed to unblock some the development community and resolve some crucial bugs. We'd like to take the opportunity to thank all the users and community developers who have reported these issues as we continue through our maintenance cycle for this version!</p>
    <p>Additionally, we would like to call attention to our announcement of work beginning on a Foundry VTT version 11.5 which will implement two key new features We are going to work on an iteration of the Foundry VTT software that represents an intermediate update between Version 11 and Version 12, "V11.5", if you will. This update will invest into two features:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-update Compatibility Check</li>
            <li>Built-in Backups</li>
        </ol>
