    <figcaption>Welcome to the Foundry Virtual Tabletop update notes for Version 9 Prototype 2.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Hello and welcome to the exciting release of Foundry Virtual Tabletop Version 9 Prototype 2, another prototype release in the Version 9 series of releases. The release of V9p2 marks the first official implementation of support for playing cards in Foundry VTT, and brings the prototyping phase for V9 to a close! We're eagerly looking forward to moving into the API development phase for V9 to add some polish to the awesome features these two releases have introduced.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Updates on the Prototype channel provide the implementation of major new features which are likely to introduce unforeseen bugs, breakages to existing game systems or modules, or other problems which will be disruptive to the usage of the software. Do not install this update unless you are doing so for the specific purposes of testing, it is not intended for use in 'live game' scenarios. The purpose of Prototype builds are to allow new experimental features to be tested and to help developers to begin the process of updating packages which are impacted by these changes. If you chose to update to this version you expose yourself to serious risk of having a bad experience. Please take this warning to heart.</p>

<p class="note warning">Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>

<p>This release is an update on the Prototype channel, and introduces a variety of new features! During this release our focus was on implementing the feature most voted for by our Patreon subscribers: Card Support. In addition to spending the majority of our development time focused on that implementation, we also took a little time to finish up some things that didn't get polished off in time for V9p1 and detoured a little to fix some bugs reported in both V9p1 and 0.8.x.</p>

<h4>Card Support</h4>
<p>This update introduces the first iteration on Card Support for Foundry VTT and brings a lot of great features the community requested as part of the scope. This introduces a new "Cards" sidebar tab which can be used to manage available decks, hands, and piles of cards- all of which can be assigned to users in your game using the standard approach to permissions. While the UI and UX still needs a bit of polish, out of the gate the Cards UI supports actions for passing cards between hands and other types of card collections, mechanics for dealing cards to one or more players, and ability to reset the deck- returning cards from all hands back to the deck they originated from. For developers: game systems can customize the data of cards through the usual<code>template.json</code> approach, and custom sheets can be registered for any <code>Cards</code> instance.  customizable data structures for cards (which the development community specifically sought). </p>
<p>In no particular order, the Cards system presently supports the following actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Perform all standard Document operations (create, edit, delete, import, export, etc.) on card stacks, whether they are decks, hands, or piles.</li>
    <li>Configure decks with descriptions, default dimensions and rotation of cards (for potential future use of canvas interactions), and the default image to display for the back of each card.</li>
    <li>Shuffle decks to provide a pre-arranged randomized order to the cards.</li>
    <li>At any time, the reset button can be used on deck sheets to return all cards belonging to this deck back to the deck itself, regardless of whether they are presently in hands or other piles. </li>
    <li>Deal a number of cards to one or more specified players from the top or bottom of the deck, or randomly from anywhere within the deck. You can also deal cards face down!</li>
    <li>From a hand window, draw a number of cards from a specified source- whether it's a deck or a different pile of cards. You can also pass cards to another player or deck (if you have permission to do so).</li>
    <li>Any card pile can also be shuffled, similar to a deck - for playing card games that have arbitrary piles of cards such as a 'discard' pile, and supports passing cards from that pile to specific players. </li>
    <li>All of these functions are, as always, exposed through the Foundry VTT API for community developers to do with as they please!</li>
</ul>
<p>We also took the time to prepare and package images for two different Foundry VTT-themed playing card decks, each with enough images to support a standard 54-card deck. If you'd like to try out these pre-built decks, you can download and import the following JSON files: </p>

<a href="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/assets/fvtt-Cards-poker-deck-light.json">Light-soft Poker Deck</a>

<h4>API Improvements and UI Changes</h4>
<p>During the testing phase for V9p1 we heard from a number of devs about changes that could be made to open parts of the API in ways that could provide more efficient paths to accomplishing features of their their systems and modules. As a result we implemented a number of API changes to expose new data to aspects of the Document schema or the canvas, and also to provide new interfaces for some existing API features. One particular feature we'd like to highlight is the introduction of the <code>keepId</code> option for Document and Compendium import and export functions. This allows documents to maintain a unique id regardless of where they are stored for convenient updating.</p>

<p>In addition to API improvements, we've begun the process of migrating a large number of CSS declarations which were individually declared previously to CSS variables. By introducing a broad amount of CSS variables commonly used throughout the UI it is our hope that community developers will have an easier time presenting a more unified look when modifying the UI. We've also refactored the "HUD" section of the UI to use a flexbox container, allowing for the rendered UI menus to be a little more conscious of where eachother are and reduce cases where certain UI elements might overlap inconveniently.</p>

<h4>Continued Lighting and Vision Improvements</h4>
<p>Version 9 Prototype 1 focused pretty heavily on retooling the lighting engine to introduce Adaptive Lighting, but as always we couldn't finish <em>everything</em> before release, so we shifted a number of items to this Release so we could spend some more time on them. While we don't introduce any new, flashy lighting features as part of this version, a lot of changes have been made to improve performance and correct for issues related to lighting and vision from V9p1.  </p>
<p>Please stay tuned as we move into the API Development phase and start fine-tuning these features and more!</p>


<h2 class="border">Breaking Changes</h2>
<h3>Documents and Data</h3>
<ul>
    <li><code>AmbientSound#data#type</code> has been deprecated in favor of providing an individual boolean flag for whether the sound is constrained by walls (or not). (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5792" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5792</a>)</li>
    <li><code>AmbientLightData#type</code> has been deprecated in favor of providing individual boolean flags for walls and vision. This allows lights to be separately configured for whether they are constrained by walls or provide additional vision.

    <li>Corrected arguments passed from <code>_onUpdateTokenActor</code> to match the standard of <code>_onUpdateEmbeddedDocuments</li>code> To correct situations where <code>Actor#_onUpdateEmbeddedDocuments</code> would be called with a differing number of arguments. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5870" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5870</a>)</li>
    <li><code>Item._preUpdate</code> should no longer ignore changes to the update delta for synthetic token actors. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5861" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5861</a>)</li>
    <li>The <code>toCompendium</code> and <code>fromCompendium</code> methods have been expanded and now support the<code>keepIds</code> option which is useful when bulk importing or exporting compendium content. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5779" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5779</a>)</li>
</ul>
