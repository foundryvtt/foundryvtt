<section id="update-overview">
    <p class="note warning"> Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Version 11 Developer 2 release of Foundry Virtual Tabletop! Our team has invested extensively into the technical foundations of our software with this release that improves the architecture, performance, and user experience of Foundry VTT. Our focus during the Development phase involves further refining prototype features and solidifying the API based on feedback from users in our Developer community. If you are a Module or System developer, this is the time to test your packages in Version 11 in order to provide us with feedback and request any API changes that would make your lives easier.</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Updates on the Development channel are intended for testing and feedback from the development community. While the features and improvements of these updates may be close to a level of stability intended for public testing, they are likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. It is not intended to use these releases for a live game.</p>
    <h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>
    <h3>Packed with Compendium Pack Improvements</h3>
    <p>Cody's deep dive into the Compendium tab continues! Compendium Packs now support a custom banner image and can be organized into folders like normal Documents. It doesn't stop there though, it's also now possible to filter by Document type, search by name, and we've added the ability to toggle between alphabetical and manual sorting for Packs and folders.</p>
    <h3>Homemade Modules</h3>
    <p>This release includes the first iteration of our Module Maker! Whether you want to share content between your worlds or are a content creator who wants to skip some of the tricky parts of making a module this new tool will make your life a lot easier. You can create as many modules as you'd like, add Authors, Compendium Packs, and Dependencies and Foundry will take care of the complicated parts for you! If you don't want to make your own modules, <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/premium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">store bought will do fine</a>.</p>
    <h3>Door Slam Jams</h3>
    <p>Shut the front door! Doors can now play audio when opening, closing, locking, or attempting to open a locked door? You've got that right! By default we're shipping 9 sets of sounds for fantasy, modern, and sci-fi doors with an easy to use API for adding even more sounds.</p>
    <h3>Stylish Setup</h3>
    <p>Each tab of the Setup screen can now be customized to display in a gallery, tile, or detail view to support multiple ways of perusing your content. We're also introducing the first phase of our Setup theme framework which currently allows you to change between two themes. We'll continue to expand and improve this framework with more themes and options in later V11 releases.</p>

<h2 class="section-header border">Breaking Changes</h2>
    <h3 class="category-header" id="breaking-canvas">The Game Canvas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Accessing <code>#actor#uuid</code> for unlinked Tokens now returns the UUID of the synthetic Actor rather than the <code>TokenDocument</code> that governs it. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5381" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(5381)</a></li>
        <li>Introduced the <code>visibility</code> field for Compendium Pack definitions which allows more granular control over which User roles can see that pack in the Compendium sidebar with backwards compatible support for previous <code>visibility</code> settings. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8284" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(8284)</a></li>
        <li>Deprecated the old-style "Pending Operations" for the Canvas and replaced them with new-style Render Flags where appropriate. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9092" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9092)</a></li>
        <li>Improved API design for the <code>CanvasDocumentMixin</code> to avoid automatically adding an associated <code>PlaceableObject</code> in the canvas layer. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9106" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9106)</a></li>
        <li>Simplified and improved the logic used to manage Token animation by taking advantage of the new <code>TokenMesh</code> data structure. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9172" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9172)</a></li>
        <li>The <code>WeatherContainer</code> instance at <code>canvas.weather.weather</code> is now removed and combined with the weather effects layer directly. Backwards compatible support for <code>canvas.weather.weather</code> is retained by redirecting back to the <code>WeatherEffects</code> layer instance. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9183" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(9183)</a></li>
