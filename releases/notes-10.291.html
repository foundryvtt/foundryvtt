<section id="update-overview">
    <p>Our dedicated developers have continued to toil away in the code forges, making Foundry V10 better with every hammer of their mechanical keyboards. This update continues our focus on bug fixes and response to community feedback and issue reporting, with several changes fixing minor user experience issues and UI bugs that cropped up and were reported. Our thanks once again goes out to the community, your diligence in finding and reporting issues has a huge impact, and we are thankful for your efforts in helping us bug hunt each release!</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> While this is categorized as a stable release there is always a possibility of unexpected bugs or compatibility issues.

    <h2 class="section-header border">Update Highlights</h2>
    <p>This update primarily focuses on fixing minor user experience hitches and canvas oddities, as well as resolving a few issues developers have found on the code side. This runs the gamut from correcting how overhead tile bounds and occlusion is handled, to making sure token scales are uniform in prototype and placed examples, and making sure that the text editor doesn't reset headers when clearing formatting. As always, we recommend checking the full list of fixes below for a detailed breakdown of what was changed in this update!</p>
