<section id="update-overview">
    <p>This latest release in the Version 13 series, Stable 7, is modest in scope. With the majority of our efforts now focused on bringing Version 14 to life and with Version 13 becoming increasingly polished, this small maintenance patch update simply resolves a few bugs and polishes a few rough edges.</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> While this is categorized as a stable release there is always a possibility of unexpected bugs or compatibility issues. As with any time you update the core software, be sure to perform a complete backup of your user data to minimize any risk of data loss.</p>
