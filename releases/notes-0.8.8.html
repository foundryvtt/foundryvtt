<p>Hello Foundry Virtual Tabletop community! We are excited to release Foundry Virtual Tabletop version 0.8.8 as a subsequent stable release in the version 8 series of updates. The version 0.8.8 release includes a variety of targeted fixes for bugs that have been reported by our dilligent community in 0.8.7 and also continues to add layers of polish to the existing feature set for this major version.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Version 0.8.8 is labeled as a stable release, but there is always the possibility of unexpected bugs or module compatibility issues. We do not recommend updating immediately prior to a game session unless you are confident in your own ability to troubleshoot any issues that arise.</p>

<h3 class="border">Update Overview</h3>

<p>As is common with stable releases, 0.8.8 primarily includes fixes for bugs rather than introducing new features.</p>
<h4>Compendium Indices and World Loading Times</h4>
<p>In version 0.8.7 we evaluated reports of increased loading times for some worlds. Upon investigation it was revealed that changes made with intent to provide faster loading of compendium data by generating indices for Compendium packs caused this behaviour. Scene compendium packs which contained thumbnails were passing base64 images into the index, resulting in some indices being generated that were of unexpectedly large size. Correcting this required introducing a breaking change for module and system developers, but in consultation with the community we have decided the benefit of this change outweighs any risk. If you are a developer negatively impacted by this please reach out to us via #08x-dev-support via our community discord for assistance.</p>
<h4>HTML Sanitization</h4>
<p>Some of you may have noticed with the advent of 0.8.x that some of the HTML you were using in rich text fields were being cleared out when you saved. This was a result of changes made for security purposes to sanitize these fields of HTML tags which could potentially be used for risky purposes. After internal discussion we have relaxed some of these restrictions and reintroduced support for iframes, video elements, and a few other ones the community provided feedback on.</p>

<h3 class="border">Breaking Changes</h3>
<h4>Documents and Data</h4>
<ul>
    <li>In consultation with the community developers which might be most impacted by this change, we have improved the methods used to index compendiums by limiting the information called initially. This should reduce the overall world loading time for those users who experienced long load times related to compendium data.

</ul>

<h3 class="border">New Features</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Changed the icon for "Remove Combatant" in the combat tracker's right-click menu, so that it is in line with other UI elements of the same type.</li>
