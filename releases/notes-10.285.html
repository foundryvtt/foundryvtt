<section id="features">
<h2 class="section-header border">New Features</h2>
    <h3 class="category-header" id="features-apps">Applications and User Interface</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Keyboard Commands for "Next", "Previous", and "Exit" in Tours. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8065" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(8065)</a></li>
        <li>Added a separate permission for pinging the canvas rather than relying on the "Display Mouse Cursor" permission. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7778" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(7778)</a></li>
        <li>When dragging Journal Entry Pages between Journals, the ID of the Page will now be preserved unless that ID already exists in the other Journal. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(8076)</a></li>
        <li>The <code>AdventureExporter</code> now provides a notification once the process has completed creating or updating an Adventure document. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8132" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(8132)</a></li>
