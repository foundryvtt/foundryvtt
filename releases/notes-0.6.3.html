<figcaption>Welcome to Foundry Virtual Tabletop Update 0.6.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Overview of Changes</h4>
<p>This is Foundry Virtual Tabletop Release version 0.6.2, a stable update on the <strong>Release</strong> channel which is available to all Foundry Virtual Tabletop license holders. The Release channel contains updates which should be stable and ready for widespread consumption by all Foundry users.</p>

<p>This update focuses on bug fixes and user experience adjustments that improve the release 0.6.0 version. The bulk of the changes included in this version are from the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/releases/0.6.1" title="Beta 0.6.1 Update" target="_blank">Beta 0.6.1 Update</a> but there are some additional adjustments, features, and fixes which are included in 0.6.2. If you have not yet read the release notes for Beta 0.6.1 I recommend starting there.</p>

<p>Since the scope of changes for this update was relatively small, there is not a Twitch developer stream associated with update 0.6.2, but stay tuned for more live-stream content coming up as I begin working on the 0.7.x generation of updates!</p>

<h4>About this Update</h4>
<p>This is a Release channel update which should be stable for all users. It is recommended for all users to update to this version unless it is immediately prior to a game session (update afterwards). Even though this update is on the release channel - remember Foundry Virtual Tabletop is self-hosted, so please take care to periodically back up any critical user data like your Worlds to protect against the unfortunate event that anything goes wrong.</p>
<hr/>

<h4>How to Update</h4>
<p>To apply this update, return Foundry Virtual Tabletop to the <strong>Configuration and Setup</strong> page and access the <strong>Update Software</strong> tab and choose the "Release (Stable)" channel in the dropdown menu. It is recommended for most users to stay on the Release channel for all updates unless you have a specific desire to get Alpha or Beta changes in the future.</p>

<p>After clicking <strong>Check for Update</strong> confirm that you are presented with the 0.6.2 update notes and click the Download button to begin the update process. Allow some time for this process to conclude, when it is finished your server will automatically restart (if Electron) or shut down (if Node.js).</p>

<p class="note info">Since the EULA was updated in version 0.6.1 you may be prompted to re-accept the Foundry Virtual Tabletop license agreement after the update is installed.</p>
