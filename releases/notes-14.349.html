<p>TODO: Preamble paragraph</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> This is a <strong>Prototype</strong> release which is experimental and unstable. It front-loads significant changes to Foundry VTT features and software API to provide the longest possible adaptation and testing period. Do not install this update unless you are doing so for the specific purposes of testing, it is not intended for use in "live game" scenarios. If you do install this release for testing, please do so in a separate sandbox environment and be sure to back up any important game data before launching any worlds in Version 14.</p>

<h2 class="border">About Version 14</h2>
<p>This release represents the initial kick-off of a brand new generation of Foundry Virtual Tabletop. We have some big goals and plans for Version 14 that are really exciting to our team and we are confident will delight you when you get your hands on them.</p>

<h3 class="border">Version 14 Epics</h3>
<p>The largest and most significant features (ones we call "epics") in Version 14 are the following:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Scene Levels (v1)</dt>
	<dd>A brand new framework for designing and playing inter-connected multi-level scenes. We are working on an internal prototype for this, but it is not yet included in V14 Prototype 1.</dd>
	<dt>Pop-out Applications</dt>
	<dd>The winner of our <a href="/article/v14-patreon-vote/" title="Version 14 Patreon Feature Vote" target="_blank">Version 14 Patreon Feature Vote</a>, Foundry Virtual Tabletop now has built-in support for rendering ApplicationV2 instances in a separate browser window! Read more about this addition below.</dd>
	<dt>Active Effects (v2)</dt>
	<dd>We have begun work on a robust set of <a href="/article/active-effects/" title="Active Effects" target="_blank">Active Effects</a> improvements designed to provide a more powerful foundation for automation of effect duration and new ways to have Active Effects apply to Actors and Tokens. Some of this work is included in V14 Prototype 1, with more yet to come in later releases.</dd>
	<dt>Scene Regions (v2)</dt>
	<dd>A key focus of V14 Prototype 1 has been improvements to the UX of creating and managing <a href="/article/scene-regions/" title="Scene Regions" target="_blank">Scene Regions</a> with significant improvements to the tools used to draw, manipulate, and visualize regions.</dd>
	<dt>DataModel Performance Improvements</dt>
	<dd>We have invested a lot of time in V14 Prototype 1 on a set of simplifications and improvements to our DataModel infrastructure that is designed to make data cleaning, validation, and updates more streamlined, more powerful, and better for performance. These changes are mostly included in V14 Prototype 1 with a few more planned improvements slated for Prototype 2.</dd>
	<dt>Scene Objects Sidebar</dt>
	<dd>One of the big planned UI/UX improvements for V14 is a new sidebar tab specialized in helping you to traverse the contents of the Scene which is currently rendered on the game canvas, making it easier to inspect that scene's contents of embedded documents distributed across the multiple levels of the Scene. This work is not yet implemented and will be coming in a later V14 prototype.</dd>
	<dt>ProseMirror Improvements</dt>
	<dd>We are prioritizing a suite of improvements to our text editing experience using ProseMirror that will make authoring Journal Entries and other HTML in Foundry VTT more powerful and easy. We will be removing TinyMCE from Foundry VTT in Version 14. We understand some of you are still fond of the legacy editor, but we hope that these ProseMirror improvements will help soften that blow. Expect these improvements coming mostly in V14 Prototype 2.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition to these epic-sized features, we are also shipping a huge number of smaller improvements that will be detailed individually in the following update notes.</p>

<h3 class="border">Version 14 Timelines</h3>
<p>We develop according to a phased development process which you can learn more about in the <a href="/article/versioning/" title="Versioning and Releases" target="_blank">Versioning and Releases</a> article.	This is only the first prototype release for Version 14, so it's impossible to commit to a timeline for the overall generation. We can at least set some preliminary expectations to help guide content creators, developers, and users with what to expect.</p>
<p>We are anticipating at least one more Prototype release which will focus on the epics that have not yet been completed in Prototype 1. This process of prototyping Version 14 will likely take us through the end of November, after which point we would begin the phases of API Development (think "alpha test" feedback from our community developers) and User Testing (think "beta test" feedback from all users) before we reach a candidate for stable release.</p>
<p>Our <em>best guess</em> at the moment is the V14 may reach a stable release in January, 2026.</p>

<h3 class="section-header border" id="v13">Minor Included Version 13 Changes</h3>
<p>Along with the sweeping Foundry VTT Version 14 changes, a few minor bug fixes and improvements that are eventually intended for an upcoming Version 13 Stable 8 got bundled up and sent along for the ride. These changes will all be included in that release's patch notes as well, but they are also included in these notes also for the sake of completeness.</p>
<h4 class="section-header border" id="v13-featues">Minor New Version 13 Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>[V13] Re-prioritized the sound played when a door changes state from <code>OPEN</code> to <code>LOCKED</code> so that the closing sound is played instead of the locking sound. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/13407" target="_blank">(13407)</a></li>
        <li>[V13] <code>RegionBehaviorConfig</code> now utilizes the form support of any <code>SchemaField</code> subclasses if they have their own <code>#_toInput</code> override. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/13412" target="_blank">(13412)</a></li>

<section id="breaking">
<h2 class="section-header border">Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>As with each major generation of Foundry Virtual Tabletop, there are some aspects of the software that our team has needed to change in order for it to work in the best possible way. Sometimes these changes are needed to improve stability or performance. Sometimes they are areas where we need a more powerful underlying design for our own future goals and needs. Sometimes they are needed to open up new opportunities for community developers using the API.</p>
<p>Version 14 does not have a massive set of breaking changes (although there may be more breaking changes that emerge during the rest of the Prototype phase). You can view the full list of Version 14 breaking changes on our project board here: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/foundryvtt/projects/67/views/8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/orgs/foundryvtt/projects/67/views/8</a>.</p>
