<p>To provide paths for our community developers to update their packages for new versions of Foundry VTT, this subsection offers articles written by the Foundry VTT Development Team which offer deeper explanations of API changes. These articles should give very clear explanations of how to address some of the breaking changes we introduce on a per-version basis.</p>
<p>If you have questions regarding any of these guides, please raise them in the appropriate development support room (currently #dev-support) on our <a href="https://discord.gg/foundryvtt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">community discord server.</a></p>
<h2 class="border">V12 Migration Guides</h2>
<p>With V12 entering the prototype phase, a preliminary outline of how the API will change for V12 is starting to take shape. Please keep in mind that this early in the V12 development cycle the API is still in a state of flux. The <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/api/v12/modules/foundry.audio.html">draft V12 API</a> is now available!</p>

<p>Additionally, V12 marks the first major generation of Foundry where information about API changes is being presented as a GitHub discussion. Please feel free to join in the discussion and help shape V12's API as it evolves into its final form. Feel free to join in!</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/discussions/10175">Audio API Improvements</a></dt>
  <dd>Primarily impacts low-level sound-playback aspects of the API, `Sound` or `AudioContainer`.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/discussions/10184">Grid Improvements</a></dt>
  <dd>V12 includes a massive overhaul for grids. A grid is now a single shader, providing substantial benefits, particularly for hex grids.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/discussions/10176">Compatibility Removals</a></dt>
  <dd>In previous generations of Foundry, a deprecation path was left intact for some breaking changes. Many of these deprecation paths will be removed in V12 and errors will now be thrown instead of warnings.</dd>

<li>The <code>name</code> field in manifest JSON files (including the dependency field) is being deprecated in favor of <code>id</code>, to reduce confusion about its purpose. There will be a deprecation period for this change and it will become enforced in Version 11. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7009" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7009</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>author</code> field in manifest JSON is being deprecated in favor of <code>authors</code> in the interest of offering a single standardized way to present the author or authors of a package. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7010" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7010</a>)</li>
<li>Introduced new <code>compatibility</code> field for package manifests which replaces the now-deprecated <code>minimumCoreVersion</code> and <code>compatibleCoreVersion</code> fields.

<section class="collapsible"><header class="collapsible-header">Documents and Data</header>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<ul>
<li>A next-generation data management layer has been designed that replaces the pre-existing <code>DocumentData</code> class with a more feature-rich and powerful <code>DataModel</code> class. This new data model is not intended solely for use with "Documents" and provides the ability to define a powerful and flexible data schema, clean or validate input data, and handle serialization and un-serialization for storage. The <code>foundry.abstract.DocumentData</code> path has been preserved for backwards compatibility. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6642" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6642</a>)</li>
<li>The new <code>DataModel</code> class is powered by a new paradigm for defining data schema using the <code>DataField</code> class and its many implementations which are available under the <code>foundry.data.fields</code> namespace. DataField instances define the type, cleaning, validation, initialization, and serialization logic for each component field of the data schema. Backwards compatibility for old object-style field specifications is preserved, where possible. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6641" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6641</a>)</li>
<li>Support of the <code>DataModel</code> functionality has been expanded to elegantly allow for the definition of inner-object structures via the <code>SchemaField</code> type. This allows for nested data structures to be declared inline as part of a model definition without requiring the use of a separate embedded subclass of <code>DataModel</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6451" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6451</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>Document</code> class has been reinvented as a subclass of <code>DataModel</code> instead of a separate logical layer which contains a <code>DocumentModel</code>. This is the most significant architectural change which we anticipate making in Version 10. It eliminates the separation of Document functionality from the underlying data structure which defines that Document. There are a number of important considerations and consequences which are involved in this change, developers are strongly encouraged to read the following GitLab issues for details. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6841" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6841</a>), (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6849" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6849</a>), (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6838" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6838</a>)</li>
<li>A specific and intentional compatibility framework has been developed for data migrations. This moves one-time data model migrations into new <code>DataModel.migrateData</code> and <code>DataModel.shimData</code> methods, which are used to provide forwards-compatibility of old data into a new schema and backwards-compatibility of new data into the prior schema. These methods are automatically used as part of Document modification workflows so that old-schema data is accepted and automatically migrated and that callback hooks can still (during their deprecation period) reference old-schema style data paths. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6825" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6825</a>)</li>
<li><code>Document.metadata</code> and <code>DataModel.schema</code> are now frozen via <code>Object.freeze</code> to prevent client-side manipulation of these configuration objects that would have unexpected consequences. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6862" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6862</a>)</li>
<li>Several fundamental <code>Document</code> attributes, specifically <code>_source</code>, <code>parent</code>, <code>apps</code>, and <code>_sheet</code> are configured to not be enumerable when iterating over keys/values of the Document. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6872" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6872</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>permission</code> field of many primary Document types has been migrated to <code>ownership</code>, with corresponding changes to CONST.DOCUMENT_OWNERSHIP_LEVELS and the <code>DocumentOwnershipConfig</code> Application. Existing documents will automatically migrate (and be shimmed) to support old "permission" access. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6867" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6867</a>)</li>
<li>Our expectations around the usage of base64 data as a mechanism for storing media data in certain document fields have been overhauled. Now, when base64 data is provided as a value to file path fields, that base64 data will automatically be persisted to disk by the server and the field value in the data schema will be replaced by a reference to the static file. The extracted files are saved within the <code>{Data Path}/Data/{Package Type}/{Package Name}/assets</code> folder and organized by document type. For example, saving a base64 image for an Actor portrait would produce a file like <code>{Data Path}/Data/worlds/testworld/assets/actors/42bie9r7pegkdz5f-img.webp</code>. An initial migration is also provided for pre-existing Worlds which will perform automatic extraction of base64 from Documents which already exist within the world. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6029" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6029</a>), (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6486" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6486</a>)</li>
<li>Primary Document types now all include a <code>_stats</code> field which tracks the following useful metadata for auditing, migration, and compatibility: <code>systemId</code>, <code>systemVersion</code>, <code>coreVersion</code>, <code>createdTime</code>, <code>modifiedTime</code>, <code>lastModifiedBy</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/3653" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">3653</a>), (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6553" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6553</a>)</li>
<li>The implementation of <code>DataModel#validate</code> has been improved and its usage as part of construction and update workflows to eliminate excessive or redundant validation and generally speed up server-side operations. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6603" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6603</a>)</li>
<li>Various <code>Scene</code> data schema fields have been consolidated and migrated to belong to an inner <code>grid</code> object. For example, <code>scene.gridColor</code> is now migrated to <code>scene.grid.color</code>. For full details of the migrated fields see the attached GitLab issue. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6852" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6852</a>)</li>
<li>A new subclass of <code>DataModel</code> has been developed for <code>ShapeData</code> which provides a reusable mechanism for adding persistence of geometric shapes as part of some other data model. This inner model has been deployed for use in the <code>Drawing</code> document in Prototype 1. We have intentions to use this for <code>MeasuredTemplate</code> as a follow-up in Prototype 2 as well as for some other future use cases which require us to persist geometric regions. As a result, several attributes of the Drawing data schema have been migrated to an inner <code>shape</code> object instead of as top-level fields. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6827" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6827</a>), (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6452" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6452</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>ChatMessage</code> document now contains an array of <code>Roll</code> objects in its <code>rolls</code> field rather than a singlular roll. This allows for chat messages to contain multiple dice roll expressions which will be rendered in order on the displayed chat card. Pre-existing messages are automatically migrated to use this new schema, and references to the prior singular <code>roll</code> field are deprecated. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6467" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6467</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>PrototypeTokenData</code> model has been refactored and redesigned, and is now renamed as <code>PrototypeToken</code> which more elegantly extends the <code>Token</code> data model with a subset of schema fields. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6840" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6840</a>)</li>
<li><code>FormDataExtended</code> has been improved and now automatically produces a correctly-typed object as <code>FormDataExtended#object</code> instead of <code>FormDataExtended#toObject</code>. This addresses several issues with incorrect handling of field types. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6986" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6986</a>)</li>
<li><code>DragData</code> creation and consumption workflows have been streamlined by using UUIDs in the interest of providing a more standardized approach across all Document types. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6990" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6990</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6166</a>)</li>
<li>Resolved some data conflicts in the <code>RollTableResult</code> caused by the new DataModel migration. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7116" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7116</a>)</li>
<li>The convention used by all <code>DocumentSheet#id</code> attributes has been standardized and now uses a combination of the class name and the Document UUID being displayed. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5652" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">(5652)</a></li>

<li>Font Awesome has been upgraded to the latest version, Font Awesome 6. This upgrade changes the appearance or names of a number of icons. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6604" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6604</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>DrawingConfig</code> class now correctly extends <code>DocumentSheet</code> rather than <code>FormApplication</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6454" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6454</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>TokenConfig</code> class now correctly extends <code>DocumentSheet</code> rather than <code>FormApplication</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6873" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6873</a>)</li>
<li>Eliminate the required assumption previously used by the core ActorSheet that Item documents within the displayed Actor would be sorted within groups by type. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6734" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6734</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>notify</code> parameter of the <code>ChatLog#postOne</code> method is moved inside an object of additional options instead of used as a positional argument. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6731" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6731</a>)</li>
<li>The font configuration API has been improved and can now provide multiple font definitions for a single family, including weight and style variants. This is a breaking change because it deprecates use of the previously used <code>CONFIG.fontFamilies</code> array. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6498" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6498</a>)</li>
<li><code>TextEditor.enrichHTML</code> parameters are now included when data is passed to custom enrich methods. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7196" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7196</a>)</li>
<li>The Audio-Video user interface has been redesigned to be a full-height sidebar panel on the left-side of the interface which can be resized.

<li>A more rigorous approach towards how distance measurement is performed for hexagonal grids has been implemented. This resolves slight inconsistencies between (1) canvas rendering, (2) ruler measurement, and (3) the <code>measureDistances</code> API. This is a breaking change because it alters the way that hexagonal grids are drawn for Scenes to be more precise and to use a more reliable padding computation. As a result of this change, newly created Scenes which use hexagonal grids will have those grids drawn using the new computation, but pre-existing hexagonal grid scenes will be flagged with a "legacy hex" core flag which will cause them to continue to use the old computations. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/4621" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">4621</a>), (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6885" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6885</a>)</li>
<li>A new, cleaned-up <code>ParticleEffect</code> API has been introduced and can be used specifically for weather effects, which has been renamed from the old <code>SpecialEffect</code> class. Underlying functionality has been migrated from the discontinued <code>pixi-particles</code> library to the new <code>@pixi/particle-emitter</code> package. This migration results in breaking API changes in how particle effects are defined. See the <a title="PIXI Particle Emitter Documentation" href="https://github.com/pixijs/particle-emitter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/pixijs/particle-emitter</a> documentation for examples of how to migrate old particle emitter configurations to the new specification.

<li>To avoid ALT-highlighting dispatching an unnecessary amount of hooks and placing objects into the hover state, the behavior of <code>_onHighlight</code> and how it delegates to <code>_onHoverIn</code> and <code>_onHoverOut</code> has been refactored to only provide an aesthetic change rather than a data one. As a consequence of this, highlighting all objects in a scene is no longer confused with nor dispatches on-hover hook events to the highlighted objects. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6800" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6800</a>)</li>
<li>The structure of the <code>EffectsCanvasGroup</code> has been refactored to remove the reliance on canvas layers for components of the canvas scene which should always be rendered without interactivity. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7013" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7013</a>)</li>
<li>A new document data field for <code>TEXTURE_DATA</code> has been introduced which standardizes how canvas-rendered textures are stored. This approach replaces the current storage of texture data as an assorted set of fields in various canvas document data classes. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/6455" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">6455</a>)</li>
<li>Eliminated container-wise separation of different canvas object types (like tiles and tokens), instead rendering their meshes as zIndex-ordered siblings directly inside the PrimaryCanvasGroup. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7113" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7113</a>)</li>
<li>Generalized the concept of elevation for Tokens and Tiles, eliminating the specialized categorization of "overhead" vs "non-overhead" in favor of a generalized method for z-index sorting and Tile occlusion. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7114" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7114</a>)</li>
<li>Changed the structure of state flags used by the PerceptionManager to flatten the flags to one dimension of depth with efficient tracking for whether a flag is dirty, and added support for flag propagation or resets. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7138" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7138</a>)</li>
<li>Restructured the PrimaryCanvasGroup to contain only the visual representation of objects that are rendered as part of the Scene, moving all interactivity with those objects to layers in the interaction group. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7086" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7086</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>VisionSource#limited</code> property for <code>PointSourcePolygon#isConstrained</code> has been removed. (<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7140" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7140</a>)</li>
<li>In favour of the new <code>PlaceableObjects</code> inside the interface group, <code>ObjectHUD</code> and <code>SynchronizedTransform</code> have been deprecated and should no longer be used. Additionally, <code>ObjectHUD#createScrollingText</code> has been refactored and moved to <code>CanvasInterfaceGroup#createScrollingText</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7293" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">(7293)</a></li>
<li>The approach used for Token animation has been generalized and now supports animating all of the visual attributes of the <code>TokenMesh</code>. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7281" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">(7281)</a></li>
<li>A new Color class has been introduced as a drop-in replacement for a hex color (number) which adds many helpful methods and properties for color manipulation and transformation. As a result, a number of helper methods have been deprecated. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7362" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">(7362)</a></li>
<li><code>HexagonalGrid</code> has received a number of changes to improve typing and method signatures for hex grid conversion methods. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7384" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">(7384)</a></li>
<li><code>Tile#getRoofSprite</code> has been removed in favour of the newly reworked Roof occlusion framework. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7121" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">(7121)</a></li>
