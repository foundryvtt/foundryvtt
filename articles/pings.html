<figcaption>A Summary of Pings and Their Functions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All pings are created by long left-click of the mouse on the game canvas while using any of the Token Control (<i class="fas fa-user"> </i>) tools. For more on token controls and how to use them, see the @Article[tokens] article.</p>

<h4>Basic Ping</h4>
<p>The most basic ping creates a pulsing circle under your cursor using your selected user color. Any users on the scene with you will see the ping, and any users on the scene with you but not looking at the same part of the canvas will see a pulsing arrow along the edge of the UI indicating the direction of the ping.</p>
<p><i class="fas fa-bullseye"> </i> Basic Pings are created by pressing and holding <strong>Left Click</strong> on the canvas.</p>

<h4>Warning Ping</h4>
<p>The warning ping creates a pulsing red triangle under your cursor. Any users on the scene with you will see the ping, and any users on the scene with you but not looking at the same part of the canvas will see a pulsing arrow along the edge of the UI indicating the direction of the ping.</p>
<p><i class="fas fa-triangle"> </i> Warning Pings are created by pressing and holding <strong>Alt + Left Click</strong> on the canvas.</p>

<h4>Drag Pings</h4>
<p>The drag view ping creates a circle on the canvas followed by a downward pointing arrow, both using your selected user color. In addition to this, all users on that scene have their cameras moved to center on the ping location. This ping function is limited to gamemaster and assistant game master users only.</p>
