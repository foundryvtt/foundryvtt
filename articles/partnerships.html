Using the power of Excel to handle all the number crunching, these managers allow users to focus on the gaming experience, and not on adding numbers. They all feature Dynamic Play, which allows various effects to be activated directly on the character. For example, if the PC receives a 'Haste' spell, the character is updated with all the effects of that spell. The Stacking rules are handled automatically, and it is possible to customize almost any class, race, feat, spell, or more.</p>
<p>For years, TOS5 users have been hard at work creating content from other sources, and sharing those creations on the friendly community forums. Hundreds of class and races have thus been shared over the years.</p>
<p>In our first partnership with Foundry VTT, <a href="https://theonlysheet.com/tosfive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TOS FIVE</a>, the manager for the 5e edition, has been upgraded to allow character to be exported in a format that Foundry VTT can import, thus allowing users to use the best character manager in conjunction with the best virtual table top app!
