The Stacking rules are handled automatically, and it is possible to customize almost any class, race, feat, spell, or more.</p>
<p>For years, TOS5 users have been hard at work creating content from other sources, and sharing those creations on the friendly community forums. Hundreds of class and races have thus been shared over the years.</p>
