<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop stores your User Data in a separate directory than the core software in order to keep it separate from the software and protect it during update periods. This directory, known as your User Data Directory, contains the configuration settings for Foundry VTT as well as all the information for your Worlds, Add-On Modules, Game Systems, and any assets you upload directly through Foundry VTT.</p>

<p>This article will guide you through the process of backing up your User Data, what pieces are most important to store, and how to move your User Data folder to a new location. We recommend making regular backups of your User Data, and especially before moving your User Data or updating Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</p>
<!-- Warning about synchronized backup services -->
<h3>Danger of Data Sync Backup Services</h3>
<p>Data sync services such as those offered by Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive, are not compatible with Foundry VTT. Foundry VTT makes frequent changes to your World's database files while running. A data sync service will inevitably attempt to copy these databases mid-operation, and can result in them being restored to a broken state at a later time, which can lead to database corruption and irreversible data loss. It is important to never use use a data sync service while Foundry VTT is running, you will permanently lose your work!</p>

<!-- Backing Up -->
<h2 class="border">Backing Up Your User Data</h2>
<p>When performing a backup, it is sometimes useful to know which files are most important to you for long term storage. The steps below go through the absolute basic approach of backing up the entire contents of the User Data folder, but if you wish to perform a more selective back up, use the following list as a guide for which folders are the most important to you:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Config</dt>
    <dd>The folder which stores important settings and secured information, including the settings you configure from the main menu. This folder is not accessible for storing assets from within Foundry VTT. It's usually advisable to back this up if you don't want to have to reconfigure your server in the event something goes awry.</dd>
    <dt>Logs</dt>
    <dd>These shouldn't need to be backed up, as the logs folder only stores the running log containing any errors or messages related to running the server.</dd>
    <dt>Data</dt>
    <dd>This folder is the equivalent to the "root" folder of Foundry VTT, and contains all assets you upload, as well as your <strong>modules</strong>,<strong>systems</strong>, and <strong>worlds</strong>. Backing this folder up in entirety is the most certain way to be able to restore your Foundry VTT to exactly the way it previously was.</dd>
    <dt>Data/worlds</dt>
    <dd>This should be your highest priority when backing up. If you back up nothing else, you should backup your worlds, as they store all of the information for your games.</dd>
    <dt>Data/modules</dt>
    <dd>These are the modules you have installed. If you use a lot of modules, you may want to back these up as well as it will make restoring them convenient.</dd>
    <dt>Data/systems</dt>
    <dd>These are the game systems you have installed. Most people don't use a diverse enough number of systems that they can't be conveniently reinstalled, so this folder rarely needs to be backed up completely..</dd>

    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Depending on your operating system, your User Data folder may be located in different locations. The defaults are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows 10 - <code>%localappdata%\FoundryVTT\</code></li>
            <li>macOS - <code>~/Library/Application Support/FoundryVTT</code></li>
            <li>Linux - <code>~/.local/share/FoundryVTT</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are the default locations, but you can change the location of your User Data folder either by changing the User Data path from the setup menu, or by editing the <code>options.json</code> file in your Config directory.

 <h2 class="border" id="restore">Restoring Your User Data</h2>
 <p>Restoring your data is as simple as closing Foundry VTT and replacing the Data, Config, and Logs directories with those stored in your backup. <b>Always check that your backup contains your data before overwriting or deleting any existing content.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Windows and MacOS - Use the steps from the previous section to navigate to your User Data folder. Replace its contents with your backup.</li>
    <li><p>Linux - Use the steps from the previous section to find the path to your User Data. Then:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Copy the <code>.tar.gz</code> file containing your backup to the User Data folder.</li>
        <li>Open a terminal and navigate to your User Data folder with <code>cd /path/to/userdata/here</code>.</li>
        <li>Use <code>tar -xvf {{foundry-backup}}.tar.gz</code>, replacing <code>{{foundry-backup}}</code> with the actual filename of your backup archive.</li></li>
        <li>if prompted, choose to overwrite your existing files.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <p class="note info">If you are using a Linux Desktop Environment such as GNOME or KDE, you can simply navigate this process using your preferred file browser, which likely supports compressing and decompressing archive files in-place by drag and drop or context menu actions.</p>
</ul>
<p>After doing this, launch Foundry Virtual Tabletop as normal.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="move">Moving Your User Data</h2>
