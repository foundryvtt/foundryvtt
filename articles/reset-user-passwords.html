<p>If a Player (or a GM!) enters an incorrect password when attempting to enter a World from the World Login screen, the following error message displays:</p>
<p class="note error">Invalid password provided for {username}!</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are several easy ways to fix this problem.</p>


<h2 class="border" id="no-password">No Password, No Problem</h2>
<p>If you or another User are having trouble logging in, first just try entering a blank password.</p>
<p>Because there is no password set by default when a new User is created (including the default, automatically created Gamemaster account), you can often log in successfully this way.</p>


<h2 class="border" id="reset-other">How to Reset Another User's Password</h2>
<p>If a GM-level User can log into a World, they can easily set a new password for any other User.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Launch the World and join it as a GM-level User</li>
	<li>Open the Settings sidebar by clicking the Gear icon (located all the way at the end)</li>
	<li>In the <span class="reference">User Management</span> screen that displays, clear out the previous password or enter a new one.</li>
</ol>


<h2 class="border" id="reset-all">How to Reset All User Passwords for a World</h2>
<p>If no GM-level user can enter the World, someone with access to the Setup screen can clear all passwords for the World so that you can log in again.</p>

</figure>
<ol>
	<li>On the Setup screen, find the World that you cannot access, right-click it, and then select <span class="reference">Edit World</span></li>
	<li>In the <span class="reference">Edit World</span> dialog that displays, check the <span class="reference">Reset User Passwords</span> box</li>
	<li>Click <span class="reference">Update World</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, the next time you launch the World, all Users will be able to log in just by entering a blank password. After clearing passwords in this way, be sure to set a new password for your Gamemaster account and any other user accounts that you'd like to be secured as soon as possible.</p>
