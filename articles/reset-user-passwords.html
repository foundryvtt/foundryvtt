<h2 id="reset">How to Reset User Passwords in Foundry VTT</h2>
<p>If you're just getting started with Foundry VTT there is no password set on the default Gamemaster account that is made when you create a world or any other accounts that you create so try logging in without one to start. If you did set a password on your or another user's account you can reset them easily by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>On the Setup screen find the world you would like to reset user passwords for and press 'Edit World'.</li>
    <li>Check the 'Reset User Passwords' option.</li>
    <li>Press 'Update World'</li>
</ol>
<p>The next time you launch your world the passwords for all users will be reset and you and your users will be able to log in without a password.</p>

<p class="note warning">Be sure to set a new password for your Gamemaster account and any other user accounts that you'd like to be secured as soon as possible to prevent anyone from making undesired changes to your Foundry VTT world.</p>
