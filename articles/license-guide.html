<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop was built with modularity in mind and provides a strong framework for creating and building Add-on Modules and Game Systems. However, creating content often requires adhering to policies from outside the Foundry community.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Many publishers and game companies provide ways to license and build supplementary material for their games, and it can sometimes be difficult to understand what is allowed under those licenses. This article is intended to help shed some light on the development process and help you do your best to not run into problems with publishers.</p>
    
<p class="info note">Disclaimer: This article was not written under the guidance of any legal professionals and should not be construed as legal advice. It is only intended to suggest some best practices in working with licensed content.</p>

<p>This article was written based on a number of other articles as well as close reading of a variety of licenses offered by various companies, source references to those can be found below.</p>

<h2 id="fair-use">About Fair Use</h2>
<p> It is commonplace to assume that copying someone's work to derive your own work is part of <strong>"fair use"</strong>, but this is not necessarily the case. The key trouble with a fair use defense is that it is a <strong>defense</strong>- it only truly becomes relevant if you have already found yourself in a situation where your lawyer is making arguments on your behalf in a court of law. </p>

<p>It is the intent of this article to help you stay out of situations where you have to make a legal defense at all, by operating in the confines of the law. This also benefits the roleplaying community as a whole, as content creators and publishers look favourably on those who respect the licensing terms of their products, and are often more open to working with them.</p> 

<h2 id="laws">Copyright, Trademark, and Licenses</h2>
<p>To understand the difficulties related to licensing when creating content for a virtual tabletop, it is important to have at least a basic understanding of Copyright, Trademark, License Agreements, and how they all work together to protect Intellectual Property.</p>

<p>In general terms, Intellectual Property (IP) refers to anything that someone has created. The owner of a piece of Intellectual Property has rights to that property protected by law, most often, this means Copyright and Trademark law. </p>

<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>
<p>Copyright law governs when it is acceptable to reproduce, publish, sell, or distribute Intellectual Property. When it comes to releasing fan-created content for a role-playing game, the very particular part of Copyright Law that concerns us is "Derivative Works". Any content which contains a part of, or are based upon, pre-existing Intellectual Property is considered a "Derivative Work".</p>

<p>Some examples of content for Foundry VTT that would be considered as Derivative works:
    <ul>
<li>A world or module containing a story intended to be played in an existing setting from a published tabletop roleplaying game. </li>
<li>A game system or module containing content from any source you didn't personally create.</li>
<li>Art such as tokens, maps, portraits, music or sound files which use original source material from another creator.</li>
<li>A module containing a package of homebrew character classes, items, spells, or weapons intended for use in an existing roleplaying game. </li>
</ul>
    
<p> When it comes to creation of work for Foundry VTT, the greatest points of concern when it comes to licensing are whether you are actually creating something of your own or whether you are simply copy and pasting whole chunks of content and republishing them. </p>

<p>>It is okay to include a line or two of text from a rulebook in the whole of a module if the module otherwise contains a much larger volume of information you have written yourself. It is not okay to take whole pages from a published rule book and place it in a FVTT addon module for distribution.</p> 

<p>If you are intending to include content written from another author, content creator, or publisher in your work, it is important to remember: </p>

<p><strong><u>The owner of a piece of Intellectual Property has the exclusive right to authorize creation of derivative works. Only the owner of copyright in a work has the right to prepare, or to authorize someone else to create, an adaptation of that work. </u></strong> </p>

<h3 id="trademark"><strong>Trademark</strong></h3>
<p>Trademark protections exist to make sure that Intellectual Property from one creator is not confused with the Intellectual Property of another. Trademarks are words, names, and symbols used to identify products. </p>

<p>When it comes to creating works for FVTT, you are far more likely to run into trouble with Trademarks than you are with copyright. Trademark infringement refers to the use of a trademark (usually in a commercial transaction) in such a way that it is likely to cause consumer confusion as to the source of those goods, or as to the sponsorship or approval of such goods.</p>

<p> For example: If I were to release a game system for Foundry VTT about protecting dens as a party of dugongs and call it "D&D", I could open myself up to legal action from Wizards of the Coast because users looking for D&D are definitely not expecting to get a nautical adventure game about territorial sea-cows.</p>

<p>Trademarks are not to be confused with Product Identity, which is covered further into this article. Instead, Trademarks are usually logos, company names, or specific names that products are sold under. A key example of this can be seen in Dungeons and Dragons: Forgotten Realms is a trademark. Faer√ªn, the world in which Forgotten Realms is set, is not. Faerun is considered product identity for the purposes of Wizards of the Coast's license agreements, but it is not trademarked. </p>

<p>Exclusive rights to a Trademark are awarded to the first person, company, or other entity to use it in commerce.</p>
<p>When publishing content for Foundry VTT, it is important to avoid the use of trademarks which might suggest that your content is endorsed or associated with the trademark holder: except if the use of those trademarks is covered by a license agreement.</p>

<h3 id="licenses">Licenses</h3>
<p>Under the broader category of Intellectual Property law, a Licensing Agreement allows the owner of a piece of Intellectual Property to give permission to another party to use that IP. This can mean allowing someone to create a derivative work, or to create officially licensed products based on that IP.</p>

<p>There are a wide variety of license agreements from various publishers, many of which are available directly on the website of the company that publishes the material you want to use. A license agreement <em>typically</em> contains very specific legal terms outlining what is and isn't okay to use when creating fan content based on their IP. These licenses often require an application process for permission, or in some cases they are open for use provided the terms are followed.</p>

<p>It can sometimes be difficult to locate the licensing information from a content creator. If you are not certain what the licensing rules are for the game, publisher, marketplace or content creator you wish to use content from, the simplest thing to do is to contact them. Often a lot of later legal strife can be prevented by talking to the creator early. If you are having trouble locating this information reach out to us using the contact form on this page, and we will gladly find and provide you with any contact information we are able to locate.</p>

<h2 id="ogl">The Open Game License</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most prolific License Agreement in the RPG publishing industry, the Open Game License (OGL) was published by Wizards of the Coast in 2000, outlining rules for using their game content. </p>

<p>The OGL's language is verbose and legal. To understand it as best as we are able (we are not lawyers, after all) we will attempt to break it down into simple language.</p>

<p> When creating content using the OGL, there are a few key areas that often go overlooked or misunderstood.</p> 
    
<p>For deeper understanding of the OGL, or further information on any portion of this breakdown, we suggest reading the OGL you intend to use very closely.</p>

<h3>Permission</h3>
<p>The OGL gives permission to use the data, usually contained in a System Reference Document (SRD) that the OGL comes packaged with or linked to. This data can be copied in whole or in part, as long as the requirements of the license are followed. </p>

<h3>Copyright Notice and Copy of License</h3>
<p>The OGL comes packaged with some legal boilerplate text which <strong>must be updated</strong> to match your content when you are distributing it, for every company you are using OGL content from. </p>

<p>In addition, if any content you are distributing is based on the content released under the OGL, you must include a copy of the OGL with your content.</p>

<h3>Product Identity</h3>
<p>The OGL defines a list of terms which the Publisher considers as Product Identity. This list can be as vague or specific as the publisher cares to be, as these terms are not necessarily Trademarks. </p>

<p>The OGL forbids the use of those terms anywhere in relation to the content you are producing using the data from the SRD. Anywhere. This includes indicating the content you created is compatible, or intended for use with, the original game. </p>

<p>That means that you can't create a Game System or Add-on Module for Foundry VTT that contains words like D&D, Pathfinder, or a number of other titles in the name of that Game System or Module. <strong>Except</strong> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a specific, secondary license from the publisher which allows you to do so.</li>
<li>The publisher has a secondary Community or Fan license agreement or policy which allows you to do so.</li>
<li>You have contacted the publisher and received express written permission to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common things considered Product Identity by a publisher are its list of Trademarks, but many publishers add additional words and logos that it considers proprietary to the game system to their list of Product Identity, which have not been trademarked.</p>

<h4>So I can't even say my D&D 5E module containing new monsters is made for D&D?</h4>
<p>That is correct. Fortunately, a number of publishers recognize the problem in that, and have released secondary policies that allow for use of Product Identity in very specific cases. Particularly ones which <strong>are not for commercial use</strong>. You will need to check if the publisher of the RPG you are making content has such a secondary policy. </p>
<p>Be sure you understand the terms of community use and fan content policies before using them, and if you have any questions reach out to the publisher for clarification.</p>

<h4 id="srd">Basic Rules and the System Reference Document</h4>
<p>Most publishers of RPGs release very basic rules for players to get started with their games. In a lot of cases this takes the form of a System Reference Document (in the cases of OGL games) or a form of "quick-start" or "basic" rules document.</p>

<p>The content of those documents are <em>usually</em> safe to use and package in a Game System or Add-on Module for use with Foundry VTT. To be sure, it is best to check the document from the publisher to see if there are any restrictions on redistributing the information that the document contains. </p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Why are most systems for Foundry VTT limited to SRD and OGL content?</strong></p>
        <p>At this time Foundry Gaming LLC does not have a commercial marketplace or any commercial license with a publisher to allow their official content to be distributed. Game Systems are community-driven, and developed by dedicated community members who distribute their hard work for free to the rest of the community.</p>
    <p><strong>Who do I contact with questions about licensing?</strong></p>
        <p>If you are a publisher with questions, or interested in discussing commercial licensing agreements please <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contact Us</a>.</p>
        <p>If you are a content creator trying to confirm if your content is compliant with a license agreement, we recommend you reach out to relevant publisher. While we will always do our best to assist you in making sure you aren't violating any agreements, the best answers about compliance will <strong>always</strong> come from the publishers themselves.</p>
    <p><strong>Who do I contact with questions about licensing?</strong></p>
    <p>I do not live in the United States of America, does all of this really apply to me?</p>
        <p>Very likely. Most countries work to ensure Intellectual Property receives equal protections under an agreement called the Berne Convention.</p>
    <p><strong>Can't I just develop and let the licensing sort itself out?</strong></p>
    <p>Foundry Gaming LLC. does not condone or support the violation of Licensing Agreements, Terms of Use, or Intellectual Property Law in any way. If you choose to develop content for use in Foundry Virtual Tabletop that violates agreements (whether willfully or through ignorance), you are opening yourself up to serious legal consequences. As we are in no way responsible for your content, we have no ability or responsibility to protect you from those legal consequences.</p>
