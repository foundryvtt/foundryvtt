<h2>FOUNDRY VIRTUAL TABLETOP COMMUNITY CONTENT KIT</h2>

<p>Foundry knows that its supportive community is one of its greatest assets, and that the dedicated and enthusiastic members of that community want to help spread our brand and show off their work. </p>
<p>So we've created a few brand-labelled assets to help the community do that. The Community Content Kit contains four transparent logos using some of Foundry's branding specifically designed to give our community a way to show that their content is intended for Foundry, all while keeping it unofficial.</p>

<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>While we want to allow members of the community to use our branding, we'd like to ask that the content using these images follow a few simple requirements:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Please do not use the Community Content Kit in a way that suggests Foundry endorses or is in any way responsible for anything you created. We want to be sure that no one thinks the awesome content you made is something that <strong>we</strong> created or paid you to create. Your content is your own. </li>
<li>Please do not use the logos from the Community Content Kit to suggest that we have verified or examined your content.</li>
<li>Please do not modify the files contained in the Community Content Kit. If you have suggestions for changes or additional styles we could release, please <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">contact us</a> instead.</li>
