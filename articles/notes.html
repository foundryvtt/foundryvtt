<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Tabletop roleplaying games often require note-taking for specific objects in a scene, or landmarks on a map. Foundry Virtual Tabletop supports the creation of Map Notes that you can easily place on a Scene, allowing gamemasters and their players to easily reference notes they've made. This article will familiarize you with the process of creating map notes, editing existing map notes, and how permissions for Journal Entry Pages determine visibility of map notes.</p>
<h2 class="border">The Journal Notes Layer</h2>
<figure class="right"><img alt="Journal Notes Tool Palette" src="https://foundryvtt.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/website-media-dev/user_671/screen/journal-notes-layer-controls-2022-08-02.jpg"/>
<figcaption>The Journal Notes Layer controls allow you to create and view Map Notes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Journal Notes layer tools provide direct access to how you interact with Map Notes. Both Players and Gamemasters can access the Journal Notes layer, though some buttons may not be available to Players.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Select Notes (<i class="fas fa-expand"> </i>)</dt>
<dd>The Select Notes tool can be used to move a placed Map Note or to interact with it:
    <ul>
        <li>Double left-click a Note to open its linked journal entry, if any.</li>
        <li>Double right-click a Note to configure it.</li>
    </ul>
</dd>
<dt>Create Map Note (<i class="fas fa-book-open"> </i>)</dt>
<dd>The Create Map Note tool allows creation of map notes anywhere on the canvas using a simple click, which can then be configured to either link to a Journal Entry, Journal Entry Page, or not as necessary.</dd>
<dt>Toggle Notes Display (<i class="fas fa-map-pin"> </i>)</dt>
<dd>Clicking this button toggles whether notes are visible on the Scene on all layers, or only while on the Journal Notes layer.</dd>
<dt>Clear Notes (<i class="fas fa-trash"> </i>)</dt>
<dd>this button deletes all currently placed notes from the Scene, permanently, with a prompt to confirm.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="view">Map Note Visibility</h3>
<p>Map Notes are not always visible - depending on a user's settings, they may only appear while the Journal Notes button is selected in the scene control toolbar. If you wish to see available map notes on the scene at all times, simply click on the Journal Notes button (bookmark icon) in the scene control toolbar, and click Toggle Notes Display (<i class="fas fa-map-pin"> </i>). Once enabled, notes will remain visible on every layer. This setting is<em>per user</em>- each player is able to toggle the visibility of Map Notes for themselves.</p>
<h4>Visible Note Indicator</h4>
<p>When an actor in a scene can see a map note, the map note icon (<i class="fas fa-bookmark"> </i>) will change to indicate this with a small purple flag. For gamemasters, this occurs when any actor in the scene can see a map note, while for players it is only active when an actor they control can see a map note.</p>
<h4>Global Visibility</h4>
<p>By default, Map Notes are obscured by Fog on scenes with Fog Exploration and will only appear when they are within the field of vision for a controlled Token. Setting the Globally Visible toggle in the configuration window for a Map Note elevates that note so that it is visible regardless of Token vision settings.</p>
<h4>Permission-based Visibility</h4>
<p>For Map Notes that are linked to a Journal Entry or Journal Entry Page, visibility is determined by the permission level configured on the Journal Entry or Page. If a player has "Limited" permissions, they will be able to see the position of the Map Note and its assigned label, but they will not be able to open it. For Image Pages, journal entries may still be opened by users with a Limited. If a Map Note has no Journal Entry associated with it, the note will be visible to all users currently viewing the scene.</p>
<p>If you right-click on a Journal Entry in the sidebar, you can conveniently "Jump to Pin" to pan the canvas to its placed Note location.</p>
<h3>Creating Map Notes</h3>
<p>Map notes can be created by a gamemaster or assistant GM or, in cases where <a href="/article/users/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Users and Permissions">Users and Permissions</a> have been have been configured to allow it. This can be done using the Create Map Note button from the Journal Notes layer, or by dragging and dropping a Journal Entry or Journal Entry page from the sidebar tab to anywhere on a Scene.</p>

<p>Deleting a placed object like a Map Note will not delete the Journal Entry that it refers to.</p>
