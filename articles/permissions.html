<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Permissions control the features available to users in any hosted World. Foundry VTT has two tiers of permission settings which can be configured to allow as much or as little restriction as needed for your game and your users.</p>
<p>By default, Game Master accounts have all permissions enabled and full control over what permissions are applied to all accounts. In addition, Game Master accounts are able to grant users permissions to edit the various entities that appear in the sidebar of Foundry VTT's main screen, such as @Article[actors], @Article[items], or @Article[journal].  </p>
<h2 id="roles">User Roles and Entity Permissions</h2>
<p>User Roles are chosen when setting up player accounts via the @Article[users] screen, and each role can be configured with default settings. Any new accounts created with that role will inherit the permissions from the role's configuration, as an example, this allows you to grant one group of users access to create new actors while restricting that permission for others.</p>
<p>Entity Permisssions control which specific users have particular levels of access to an entity. For example, a player with Owner permissions to an actor has full control of that actor, they can edit the character sheet, move the token, and they see what the token sees when it is controlled on the canvas. </p>
