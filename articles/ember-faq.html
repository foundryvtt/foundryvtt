    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p><a href="https://foundryvtt.com/ember/" target="_blank">Ember</a> Ember is an online tabletop roleplaying game which is a hybrid between a tabletop RPG and a multiplayer digital game. It has all the elements of a traditional pen & paper RPG but is enhanced with features inspired by video games to create a compelling hybrid of dynamic gameplay and a classical foundation. It is a collaborative storytelling experience for a gamemaster and group of players. Ember has been made specifically to be played online in Foundry Virtual Tabletop and has a ton of additional features, systems, and mechanics to facilitate and enhance gameplay.</p>             
        <p>After our successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foundryvtt/ember-rpg/" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> we have been working tirelessly to bring the finished Ember product to the masses with a timely release schedule.</p>

        <p>Beta Access enables users to play Ember's content several months before its full release date, though many features will still be unfinished and some content will not be available as development is still occurring in this phase.</p>
        <p>The Alpha Access period has concluded and allowed users to begin playing ember a full year before its release, albeit with many unfinished features and some content unavailable as development is ongoing.</p>

    <header id="whatis" class="collapsible-header">What Game Systems does Ember support?</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Ember is being designed with two rulesets in mind: <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dnd5e/" target="_blank">Dungeons & Dragons (2024)</a> and <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/crucible/" target="_blank">Crucible</a>— a bespoke system designed specifically for Foundry Virtual Tabletop.  While the D&D version may remain compatible with the D&D 2014 rules, Ember is being designed with the 2024 rules in mind.</p>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header id="whatis" class="collapsible-header">Will Ember Support Pathfinder Second Edition?</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>We love Pathfinder 2e, but we have made a thoughtful decision to focus on D&D Fifth Edition and Crucible as the two systems we can feasibly support. It's going to be a huge amount of effort to support dual-system compatibility, and the additional complexity of offering PF2E also is, unfortunately, beyond us at this time.</p>
        <p>We are committed to delivering the best possible experience for these two systems. Once that is done, there's always the possibility to re-assess and explore additional options.</p>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header id="whatis" class="collapsible-header">Will there be localization or foreign language support for Ember?</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>We aren't doing any official translations aside from English at this time, however Ember is created using all of the localization tools that Foundry Virtual Tabletop supports so the possibility is there to offer alternate language versions in the future!</p>
        <p>The scope of Ember is vast though, so the cost of creating (and importantly maintaining) non-English translations would be significant. It's on our minds as something we can add when the time is right!</p>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header id="whatis" class="collapsible-header">Can we use the Vistas feature in other games?</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>You will be able to use Vistas in any game world where you have the Ember module active - which would require the world to be using either the D&D 5e or Crucible game system.</p>
        <p>We hope that eventually we can fully generalize the Vista engine to become part of the core Foundry Virtual Tabletop software so that every game system can use them (provided they have suitable art assets). The timeline on that could be lengthy though. It's much easier to build the Vista engine for the specific Ember use case than it is to build it generally for all use cases.</p>
        <p>Hopefully someday, but for now Vistas are a unique selling point of the Ember experience.</p>
