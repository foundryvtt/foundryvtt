<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This article covers all of the roll modifiers that Foundry VTT currently offers and how to use them. For an introduction to simple dice concepts see the @Article[dice] article. For more advanced dice rolling concepts, and API references see the @Article[dice-advanced] article.</p>

<h2 id="modifiers" class="border">Roll Modifiers</h2>
<p>In addition to basic arithmetic and adding text comments to rolls, there are a variety of short-hand modifiers which can be used to change the way a dice roll is processed. These modifiers are conditional, and only trigger in certain (defined) circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="reroll">Re-rolls and Exploding Dice</h2>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column" style="flex:2">
<dl>
    <dt>r : Reroll</dt>
    <dd>Rerolls the die based on the set condition, keeping the outcome regardless of whether it is better. Reroll (r) will only reroll the die once, for continual rerolling see "x : explode"</dd>
    <dt>rr : Recursive Reroll</dt>
    <dd>Rerolls the die based on the set condition, and rerolls that result if it also meets the criteria, or keeps it if it does not. Unlike Reroll (r) which will only reroll the die once, recursive reroll will keep rolling as long as results meet the reroll criteria.</dd>
    <dt>x : Explode</dt>
    <dd>Rerolls a die continually based on the set condition, so that each occurrence of the number rolls again, continually adding to the total result.</dd>
    <dt>xo : Explode Once</dt>
    <dd>Rerolls a die once based on the set condition, used primarily by games which use a "dice pool", adding to the total result.</dd>

<h2 id="keeping">Keeping or Dropping Results</h2>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column" style="flex:2">
<dl>
    <dt>kh, k : Keep Highest</dt>
    <dd>Whether you use 'kh' or the shorter 'k', this modifier causes the dice roller to keep a number of dice you specify, selecting the highest of the roll results available. Without a specified number it will keep the single highest number. If the number of dice rolled is less than the number of dice being kept, then it will keep all the rolls made.</dd>
    <dt>kl : keep lowest</dt>
    <dd>This modifier causes the dice roller to keep a number of dice you specify, selecting the lowest of the roll results available. Without a specified number it will keep the single lowest number. If the number of dice rolled is less than the number of dice being kept, then it will keep all the rolls made.</dd>
    <dt>dl, d : drop lowest</dt>
    <dd>This modifier causes the dice roller to drop a number of dice you specify, selecting the lowest of the roll results available. If a number of dice to drop is not specified, then it will drop the lowest number rolled. If the number of dice is less than the dice being dropped, then it will keep all the rolls made.</dd>
    <dt>dh : drop highest</dt>
    <dd>This modifier causes the dice roller to drop a number of dice you specify, selecting the highest of the roll results available. If a number of dice to drop is not specified, then it will drop the highest number rolled. If the number of dice is less than the dice being kept, then it will keep all the rolls made.</dd>
    <dt>min : replace with minimum</dt>
    <dd>This modifier causes the dice roller to replace any numbers lower than the result specified. Anything over the minimum is kept. If a minimum result is not specified, then it will roll the dice as normal without replacing any results.</dd>
    <dt>max : replace with maximum</dt>
    <dd>This modifier causes the dice roller to replace any numbers higher than the result specified with the maximum number. Anything under the maximum is kept. If a maximum result is not specified, then it will roll the dice as normal without replacing any results.</dd>

<div class="columns">
    <div class="column" style="flex:2">
<dl>
    <dt>cs : Count Successes</dt>
    <dd>This modifier causes each die that rolls a specified result to be counted as a success which is tallied when the roll concludes. Without a specified number to succeed, all dice rolled are considered successes. This modifier can have the requirements for success specified through several comparison symbols, as follows:</dd>
    <dt>cs={y}</dt><dd>Count the number of dice which resulted exactly in y.</dd>
    <dt>cs&gt;{y}</dt><dd>Count the number of dice which rolled greater than y.</dd>
    <dt>cs&gt;={y}</dt><dd>Count the number of dice which rolled greater than or equal to y.</dd>
    <dt>cs&lt;{y}</dt><dd>Count the number of dice which rolled less than y.</dd>
    <dt>cs&lt;={y}</dt><dd>Count the number of dice which rolled less than or equal to y.</dd>
    <dt>even : Count Evens</dt>
    <dd>This modifier counts any dice that generate an even number as a success.</dd>
    <dt>odd : Count Odds</dt>
    <dd>This modifier counts any dice that generate an odd number as a success.</dd>
    <dt>cf : Count Failures</dt>
    <dd>The syntax of this modifier works identically to count success, but counts the number of dice that failed to meet the specified criteria.</dd>
    <dt>df : Deduct Failures</dt>
    <dd>This modifier is used to specify the criteria for a die result to be a failure, then deducts the number of failures from the dice result, counting each failure as -1. The criteria for failure are specified identically to count success. It is intended primarily for use with Count Success, but also functions on its own.</dd>
    <dt>sf : Subtract Failures</dt>
    <dd>This modifier sets a failure criteria, and any die that meets that criteria has its roll subtracted from the final result. The criteria for failure are specified identically to count success.</dd>
    <dt>ms : Margin of Success</dt>
    <dd>This modifier subtracts a target value set by the user from the result of the dice rolled, and returns difference as the final total. If the amount rolled is less than the target it outputs a negative number, and a positive number if there is a remainder after subtraction.</dd>

        <p>Coins are two-sided dice with two results: heads, or tails. They can be rolled as any other die, but are not affected by mathematical expressions, though they can still be combined with other dice types. Coins also allow the roller to call (c) a specific result in advance, which will treat rolling coins similarly to "count success". By default, Coins tally the number of heads as successes in the results.</p>
