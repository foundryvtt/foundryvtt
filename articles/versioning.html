<p>This article presents the basics of the Foundry VTT development cycle and what to expect from a Foundry VTT release or Game System based on its version information.</p>
<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: You should never attempt to run a live game using anything other than a Stable Release. This is especially true if you use many modules in your games.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="core-versions">Foundry VTT Release Types and Versioning</h2>
<p>To understand Foundry releases and versioning, it is important to know the basics of the Foundry VTT development cycle.</p>
<p>At first, new features are sketched in and changes are made freely and rapidly. As we get closer to release, the pace of change slows as the focus shifts more towards refinements and bug fixes. Finally, Foundry VTT is deemed feature-complete and reliable enough to create the first Stable build of the next generation of Foundry VTT.</p> 

<h3 id="Phases">The Phases of the Foundry Development Cycle</h3>
<p>Each time work starts in the development cycle for a new "generation" of Foundry VTT, it is given the next major version number (for example, 13) and is referred to as "Version 13" or "V13" for short.</p>
<p>During this development cycle, each release is categorized by the current phase of the development cycle:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Prototype</dt>
        <dd>The first few releases of the development cycle of a new generation. These "first draft" releases may change wildly and are only really useful for developers who are curious about about the initial thoughts of the Foundry VTT team.</dd>
    <dt>Development</dt>
        <dd>In the development phase, general ideas and approaches solidify a bit more. Focus shifts towards becoming feature-complete and addressing community developer feedback.</dd>
    <dt>Testing</dt>
        <dd>In the Testing phase, the focus shifts to refining the existing major features, bug fixes, and perhaps adding some last minor features.</dd>  
        <dd>Curious power users can now start checking things out. Be sure to take a <a href="/article/backups/">Backup</a> of all your important Worlds first, though!</dd>
    <dt>Stable</dt>
        <dd>Once Stable hits, the new generation is ready for primetime and live games. Make sure to <a href="/article/updating/">update safely</a>, though!</a>!</dd>
        <dd>A few more "maintenance" Stable releases may be released to refine features and fix any remaining bugs, and then the cycle begins anew.</dd>

        <h3 id="versions">Understanding Versioning</h3>
        <p>In the image to the right, Foundry Virtual Tabletop is running <code>Foundry V13 Testing 3</code>, also called <code>13.338</code>. What does this mean?</p>
        <p>Looking at the Foundry VTT version information, we see that this is <code>Foundry VTT V13 Testing 3</code>, meaning that it is the third build in the Testing phase of the 13th generation of Foundry Virtual Tabletop. This user is likely running their live games in Foundry VTT V12 Stable and carefully installed this build to check out the next major Foundry VTT version, V13. They may also do some testing to see how some of their favorite modules are running in it.</p>
        <p>The <code>338</code> in the screenshot is the exact build number. This release can also be referred to by its generation number and build number (<code>13.338</code>) as a convenient shorthand.</p>
        
        <h3 id="package-versioning">Game System Versioning</h3>
        <p>Additionally, we see that Foundry VTT is using the D&D 5E game system.</p>
        <p>Although versioning methods vary between game systems, generally speaking the first number always indicates the major version of the game system and is incremented when major changes are made. If the either the first or second number increments, you should assume that some modules may no longer be compatible with that version until they update. If only the last number increments, a more minor update was likely deployed and most modules should not be affected.</p>
