    <figcaption>Our Patreon Community Votes on a Major Feature for Version 14</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Following the stable release of Foundry VTT Version 13, our sights are now set on the prioritization and planning stages of Version 14 and all the fun and excitement that comes with a new prototyping phase. While we will, of course, continue to release updates for V13 to maintain its stability and correct bugs, we&#39;ve already begun laying out our plans for the next stage of Foundry VTT development. As always, that process begins with opening a poll for our Patreon Community to vote on a major feature which we will prioritize for development. </p>
<h2 class="border"id="planned-features">Planned Features</h2>
<p>Of course, while our Patreon feature prioritization poll helps us select a feature the community would like us to prioritize, we also have our own internal goals planned for the forthcoming V14.</p>
<h2 class="border"id="scene-layers">Scene Layers</h2>

<h2 class="border"id="-">???</h2>
<h2 class="border"id="-">???</h2>
<h2 class="border"id="feature-prioritization-poll">Feature Prioritization Poll</h2>
<p>In addition to the features we&#39;re planning for our own development goals, we will prioritize one feature from the following list as selectted by our Patreon Supporters. It&#39;s important to emphasize that all of the features on this list are ones which we plan to implement at some future time; these votes are intended to help us choose which feature we&#39;ll develop right now, in this version, not choose the only feature from the list we will ever develop. It&#39;s also worthy of note that some of the options on these polls come and go depending on a number of factors, so we may have some options returning to this poll that weren&#39;t on the previous one, and some options that were on the previous poll may not be here. Options that are missing are not removed from our plans, merely not something we feel we could reasonably develop as part of the focus of this version.</p>
<p>Enough caveats and addendums and preamble, let&#39;s get to the choices:</p>
<h2 class="border"id="advanced-measured-templates">Advanced Measured Templates</h2>
<p>An expansion of the existing Measured Templates system and add new features like template animation support, improved customization for template shapes, and the ability to link Templates to a Token.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve ever wanted to visually see the arc of your lightning or the blast of a fireball, animations are for you. For the more defensively minded, linking a template lets you walk around with auras. Combat can be not only more exciting but sped up with accurate template-zones based on walls, allowing you to easily target (and blow up) the right people.</p>
<p>This feature would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support attaching a Template to a Token so that the Template moves along with the Token.</li>
<li>Improve integration with the targeting system so the placement of Templates can auto-target Tokens within its area of effect.</li>
<li>Add an API framework for rendering beautiful animations inside of Template shapes.</li>
<li>Add an option that will constrain the area of Measured Templates according to nearby walls.</li>
<li>Add support for video textures to be used for Template fill textures.</li>
</ol>
<p>This feature might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Include built-in animation options for common effects like Fire, ice, lightning, force-fields, and more.</li>
<li>Add a framework to apply a visual filter or animation onto Tokens inside the Template area.</li>
<li>Other improvements related to Measured Templates and their interaction with other software components.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border"id="document-tags-and-improved-search">Document Tags and Improved Search</h2>
<p>You can never have enough tools in the toolbox when it comes to keeping your games organized. Document Tags would allow users to assign special Tags to any existing Document (such as Journal Entries, Actors, Items, etc.) solely for the purposes of improving organization and search-ability.</p>
<p>This feature would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a convenient and easily-accessible way to search all available Documents by name or Tag.</li>
<li>Allow any Document to be assigned Tags which map to a user-defined or package-defined hierarchy. For example:
<ul>
    <li>an Actor could be given Tags like ancestry: elf, class: fighter:battlemaster, gender: non-binary, build: athletic.</li>
    <li>An Item might be given Tags like: category: staves:magical, effect: spellcasting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A JournalEntryPage could be given Tags like location: town:ferncombe, organization:delvers, disposition: hostile.</li>
</ol>
<p>This feature might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow using the search results for Document Tags to create a convenient Rollable Table for easy randomization, such as generating a table of enemies for a random encounter or randomized loot results.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border"id="improved-drawing-tools">Improved Drawing Tools</h2>
<p>Sometimes your players just insist on going to places you don&#39;t have a scene prepared for. A lot of GMs fall back on using drawing tools to provide a rudimentary representation of a tactical map, and there&#39;s no harm in that! Many users have suggested that the drawing tools, while valuable as they exist now, could do with a little development love and some improved features.</p>
<p>This feature would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a more streamlined interface for the existing drawing tools using a new application for quickly changing line thickness, fill, color settings, opacity, and degree of smoothing (for the freehand drawing tool).</li>
<li>Provide ability to quickly switch between recently used colors using a color palette.</li>
<li>Allow for additional quick-change options on the Drawings HUD, such as ability to quickly flip and rotate drawings.</li>
<li>Include new line types such as dashed lines, and arrows.</li>
<li>Improve the existing Text drawing type to support additional text styles and multiline editing.</li>
</ol>
<p>This feature might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide enhanced features for freehand drawings, including an eraser tool, and potentially allowing multiple freehand strokes to combine into a single drawing Document.</li>
<li>Provide a quick configuration for drop shadow on drawings, to help them stand out from the background or provide a simple sense of depth of a drawn object such as a wall.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border"id="improved-vision-and-detection-modes">Improved Vision and Detection Modes</h2>
<p>The initial implementation of Vision and Detection modes was a great first step, but there are definitely some areas where we can improve upon that iteration. Prioritizing this feature would allow us to make the handling of vision modes a little more convenient for GMs and players alike in an effort to get that scene feeling as immersive as possible.</p>
<p>This feature would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a way for the Owner of a Token to quickly toggle their active Vision Mode from the Token HUD.</li>
<li>Support configuration of Vision and Detection Mode interaction with darkness sources.</li>
<li>Allow configuring "Important" detection modes, which always render an effect on a detected token even if the token was detected by some other detection mode.</p>
<li>Provide support for "Imprecise" detection modes, which only reveal the size and location of the detection token, but not the token's identity.</li>
<li>Include an API for "can Token A see Token B (with Detection Mode X), at all, precisely, or imprecisely."</p>
<li>Support detection modes, that on its own cannot detect anything, but make it possible to detect something that another detection mode couldn't normally. For example, See Invisibility would only detect an invisible Token if some other sight-based detection mode of the Token like Light Perception or Darkvision could see the Token if it didn't have the Invisible status.</li>
<li>Remove Vision Range in favor of selecting the Detection Mode that the Token should view the canvas with.</li>

</ol>
<p>This feature might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support for grid-based point source shapes and range tests.</li>
<li>Add additional vision modes effects to the existing list,  such as effects to represent "Thermal" vision or "Echolocation".</li>
<li>Improve the API for automatic detection mode preparation based on the actor senses.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border"id="manual-fog-of-war">Manual Fog of War</h2>
<p>One of the most commonly requested features from fans of a more &quot;classic&quot; VTT experience. The goal here would be for us to provide a suite of tools allowing Gamemasters to have a more hands-on, table-like experience for managing the reveal of Fog of War for players by marking areas of the map as revealed or obscured.</p>
<p>This feature will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a GM with tools to draw geometric shapes (rectangle, ellipse, polygon) that remove or add fog of war for players.</li>
<li>Allow for manual fog of war exploration to be shared across all players.</li>
</ol>
<p>This feature might:</p>
<li>Allow for dynamic fog of war exploration to be shared across all players.</li>
<li>Support a mode which prevents tokens from moving outside the explored fog of war area.</li>
<li>Support a hybrid fog of war experience where manually revealed fog of war is carried over to the dynamic fog of war system.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border"id="special-effects-regions">Special Effect Regions</h2>
<p>While ambient light sources offer a wide variety of animated effects that can really bring a scene to life. It&#39;s been a long-stated goal for us to provide a way for users to animate their scenes without having to also pierce the fog of war with a light. The goal for Special Effects Regions would be to build on the existing Scene Regions framework to allow GMs and content creators even more ways to make their scenes shine.</p>
<p>This feature would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extend the V12 Scene Regions system with a suite of Region Behaviors designed specifically to support visual effects rendered in scenes.</li>
<li>Provide a set of built-in animated effects that can be applied to Scene Regions, such as: <ul>
<li>Fire</li>
<li>Roiling Smoke</li>
<li>Swirling Fog</li>
<li>Rippling Water</li>
<li>Bubbling Lava</li>
<li>Electricity</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide an API framework allowing system and module developers to define new shader-based animations to be displayed on Scene Regions.</li>
</ol>
<p>This feature might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support particle emitters in addition to shader-based effects.</li>
<li>Support Ambient Audio effects within a specific region as an alternative to point-source based sound effects.</li>
<li>Support configuring illumination options, allowing a GM to assign a region that pierces the fog of war.</li>
<li>Support weather effects localized to a specific region.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border"id="canvas-placeable-items">Canvas-Placeable Items</h2>
<p>Imagine the scene:  your party enters a room dominated by a statue clutching a gleaming red gem, the legendary artifact they&#39;ve been searching for. With placeable items, that legendary Item that has been stored in your Sidebar can now exist on the map for your players to loot directly into their inventory. If your players are motivated by exploration, discovery, and the pursuit of treasure - the Placeable Items system will allow you to provide deeper engagement and immersion for the environments you create.</p>
<p>This feature effectively allows Items to be placed directly onto a Scene, unlocking the ability for Players to find and acquire treasure or plot-advancing items by interacting directly with the game Canvas.</p>
<p>This feature would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement a new embedded Document type which allows Items to be placed within a Scene.</li>
<li>Add a new Canvas layer that contains and displays Items which are present within a Scene.</li>
<li>Placed Items can be viewed and added to Actor inventories.</li>
<li>Placed Items can have a customized appearance similar to the features offered for Tokens.</li>
</ol>
<p>This feature might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow combining bundles of Items together which can support cases like a Treasure Chest that contains multiple things.</li>
<li>Integrate placeable items with Detection Modes to allow certain items to be invisible or hidden from view and only reveal under certain conditions, for cases like a &quot;detect magic&quot; spell, or a &quot;thermal goggles&quot; effect.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border"id="pop-out-application-windows">Pop-Out Application Windows</h2>
<p>Advanced support for multiple monitors has been something we&#39;ve often wanted to pursue as a feature, and we now believe there is a reliable way for us to do so. Thanks to advancements made during V13&#39;s UX and UI overhaul, we hope that we could now provide a more reliable way for users to manage their interactions with Foundry VTT using multiple application windows.</p>
<p>This feature would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow users to quickly move an application window out of the bounds of the Foundry VTT viewport, to a new browser tab.</li>
<li>Provide better handling for users with multiple monitors, allowing them to dedicate secondary screen real-estate to particular Applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>This feature might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remember the last-used position and state of a pop-out window, so that it is automatically restored to the previous position and size when it is re-opened.</li>
<li>Allow Users to pop out specific UI control elements, such as the Audio Visual Chat window, hiding them from the main application window rather than merely duplicating them.</li>
</ol>
