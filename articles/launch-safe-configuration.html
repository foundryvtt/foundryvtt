<h2 id="necessary">When Is This Necessary?</h2>

<p>If a module incompatibility, macro, script, or other issue has made it impossible to load into your world then launching in the Safe Configuration can be helpful. When checked, the next time you launch your world Foundry will disable all modules, deactivate all scenes, and stop all playing tracks. Once you've launched your world this setting will automatically be turned off so the next time you launch your world any re-activated modules, scenes, or restarted tracks will remain as you set them.</p>
