<p>You may be prompted to enter a server Administrator password in two different screens:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Foundry Login Screen</li>
    <li>The World Login Screen</li>
</ul>

    <figcaption>Entering an incorrect Administrator password in the Foundry Login Screen and the World login Screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you enter an invalid Administrator Password in either of these two screens, the same error message displays:</p>
<p class="note error">The provided server administrator password is invalid. If you have forgotten your configured password you will need to manually delete the <strong>Config/admin.txt</strong> file from your user data location.</p>

<h3 class="border" id="no-password">First, Is There an Administrator Password Set?</h2>
<p>When you are just getting started with Foundry VTT, for security reasons you may see this error message even though you have not set an Administrator password yet. The easiest way to double-check whether there currently is an Administrator password is to close and re-open Foundry.</p> 
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>If you are prompted for an Administrator password</strong> immediately when you launch Foundry, there is an Administrator password set.</p>
        <p>If you do not know this password, you will need to reset the Administrator password now. See <a href="#resetting">Resetting Your Administrator Password</a> below for instructions.</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <p><strong>If you are <u>not</u> prompted for an Administrator password</strong> immediately when Foundry launches and the Setup screen displays instead, there is no Administrator password.</p>
        <p>Setting an Administrator password now is highly recommended. See <a href="#setting">Setting an Administrator Password</a> below for instructions.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3 class="border" id="resetting">Resetting Your Administrator Password</h2>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <p>Fortunately, if you can't remember your Administrator password, you can reset it yourself by finding and deleting a single file.</p>
        <p>One of two methods may be used to locate this file:</p>
        <h4>The "Browse User Data" Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If Foundry isn't already running, launch it now</li>
            <li>Right-click the small Foundry icon in your Windows taskbar or Dock (typically located along the bottom of your screen)</li>
            <li>Select the "Browse User Data" option, then close Foundry</li>
            <li>In the folder that displayed, open the 'Config' folder and delete the 'admin' (or 'admin.txt') file inside it</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now, when you re-open Foundry again you should be able to access the 'Setup' screen and <a href="#setting">set a new Administrator password</a>.</p>
        <h4>Finding Your Foundry User Data Folder Manually</h3>
        <p>This 'Config' folder that contains 'admin.txt' is located in your Foundry User Data folder. If you cannot open this folder using the "Browse User Data" method, please <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/configuration/#where-user-data">follow these instructions</a> to find and delete the 'admin.txt' file instead.</p>

<p class="info note">If you use one of <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/partnerships">our official hosting partners</a> instead of running Foundry directly on your own computer, this process may be different. If you use such a service and these instructions do not match what you are seeing, please contact your hosting service directly for assistance.</p>


<h3 class="border" id="setting">Setting an Administrator Password</h2>
<p>In the Setup screen, you can set the Administrator password by clicking the gear-shaped "Configure" button located near the top-right of the screen.</p>
<figure> <img class="center" src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_681/reset-admin-set-admin-2025-02-04.webp" alt="Setting a new Administrator password using the 'Configure' button"> 
    <figcaption>Setting a new Administrator password using the "Configure" button</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 class="border" id="additional-info">Additional Information</h2>
<p>On the World Login screen, when you attempt to use the "Return to Setup" button, you can encounter an "incorrect server Administrator password" error even though no Administrator password is set.</p>
<p>This might seem counterintuitive, but this is for security reasons. Throwing the generic "incorrect Administrator password" error prevents unauthorized access and also doesn't reveal that there is no server Administrator password. If you would like to use this 'Return to Setup' feature in the World Login screen, simply <a href="#setting">set an Administrator password</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the World Login screen, there is another way to get back to Setup without restarting Foundry or entering the Administrator password:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Log in to the World as a Gamemaster-level account (if you don't know the password, try logging in without one)</li>
    <li>In the 'Settings' sidebar (the gear icon all the way at the end), click the 'Return to Setup' button at the bottom of the tab.</li>
</ol>
