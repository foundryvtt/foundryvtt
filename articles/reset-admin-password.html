<h2>When Is This Necessary?</h2>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <p>If you're unable to access Foundry or use the 'Return to Setup' feature because you have forgotten your Administrator Password you will need to reset it so you can set a new, more memorable password. If you enter an incorrect Administrator Password you'll be greeted with this error message:</p>

        <p class="note error">The provided server administrator password is invalid. If you have forgotten your configured password you will need to manually delete the <strong>Config/admin.txt</strong> file from your user data location.</p>

        <p>By default Foundry VTT doesn't set an Administrator Password so if you're not prompted for one when you launch Foundry that means one was never set. As a result you won't be unable to take advantage of the 'Return to Setup' feature on the World Login screen until you've added one.</p>

        <p>If you're stuck on the World Login screen and unsure of how to get back to the Setup screen you can log into the world using a Gamemaster account (if you just created your world the Gamemaster account doesn't have a password by default so you can log in without one). Then click on the 'Settings' tab in the right-hand sidebar (gear icon) and press 'Return to Setup'. Then you can set the Administrator password in the 'Configuration' tab.</p>

<h2 id="no-admin">What If There Is No admin.txt File?</h2>
<p>If you don't find an <code>admin</code> file that means that one was never set. You'll want to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Log in as a Gamemaster level account (if you don't know the password, try logging in without one)</li>
    <li>Click on the 'Settings' tab (the gear icon) in the right-hand sidebar</li>
    <li>Click 'Return to Setup'</li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to use the 'Return to Setup' feature you can change to the 'Configuration' tab and set an Administrator Password.</p>
