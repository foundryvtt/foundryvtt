<h2>When Is This Necessary?</h2>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <p>If you're unable to access Foundry or use the 'Return to Setup' feature because you have forgotten your Administrator Password you will need to reset it so you can set a new, more memorable password. If you enter an incorrect Administrator Password you'll be greeted with this error message:</p>

        <p class="note error">The provided server administrator password is invalid. If you have forgotten your configured password you will need to manually delete the <strong>Config/admin.txt</strong> file from your user data location.</p>

        <p>By default Foundry VTT doesn't set an Administrator Password so if you're not prompted for one when you launch Foundry that means one was never set. As a result you won't be unable to take advantage of the 'Return to Setup' feature on the World Login screen until you've added one.</p>

        <p>If you're stuck on the World Login screen and unsure of how to get back to the Setup screen you can log into the world using a Gamemaster account (if you just created your world the Gamemaster account doesn't have a password by default so you can log in without one). Then click on the 'Settings' tab in the right-hand sidebar (gear icon) and press 'Return to Setup'. Then you can set the Administrator password in the 'Configuration' tab.</p>
