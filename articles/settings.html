<h5 class="release-date">Updated October 21, 2025 (Version 13.350)</h5>
<h2 class="border" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop features a number of configurable settings which are accessed by clicking the <i class="fas fa-cogs"> </i> <strong>Configure Settings</strong> button found inside the Game Settings tab (<i class="fas fa-cogs"> </i> on the sidebar). The settings here allow you to customize your FVTT experience and the way you interact with the software.</p>
<p>These settings differ from the @Article[configuration] settings, which are controlled by the server host.</p>


<h2 id="scopes" class="border">Setting Scopes</h2>
<p>Settings don't apply universally for all users and worlds. How widely a setting is applied depends on its scope:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Client Settings</strong></dt> 
    <dd>
      <p>Client settings apply for a single browser on a single "client" device (for example, only when using Chrome on your laptop). However, they apply to any Foundry VTT World that you connect to while using it.</p>
      <p>Client settings are best used to control device-specific settings such as <a href="maximum-framerate">Maximum Framerate</a> and <a href="performance-mode">Performance Modes</a>.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><strong>User Settings</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>User Settings only apply for a single User in a single World.</p>
      <p>This type of setting allows the user to customize their own experience in a World, regardless of the browser or client device that they are using to connect.</p>
      <p class="info note version v13"><strong>Note:</strong> The User Setting scope is new to Version 13.</p>
    </dd>    
  <dt><strong>World Settings</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>World settings apply to a single World, but they apply universally to all users and client devices connected to that World.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>Any user can always control their own Client Settings and User Settings, but only Assistant Gamemasters or users who have the Configure Settings <a href="/article/users/#user-roles">user permission</a> can configure World settings.</p>


<h2 id="settings-tab" class="border">The Settings Tab</h2>

<p>Although there are many available settings, you can use the sidebar on the left to search or you can pick a system or module from the list to view all the settings it adds.</p>

<h3 id="sub-menus" class="border">Settings sub-menus</h3>
<p>Some settings have their own sub-menus to help organize related configuration options. Notable core sub-menus include:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Configure Permissions (<i class="fas fa-user-lock"> </i>)</dt>
    <dd>Opens a separate configuration menu to customize permission controls for different User roles. See the @Article[users] for more details.</dd>
  <dt>Default Prototype Token Overrides (<i class="fas fa-font"> </i>)</dt>
    <dd>This button opens a separate configuration menu that allows you to automatically set properties for all tokens that you create. For details, please see @Article[tokens] article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Changes to these game settings are only applied when the <i class="fas fa-save"> </i> <strong>Save Changes</strong> button is clicked. Some changes may cause the browser to automatically refresh.</p>

<h3 id="notable-client-settings" class="border">Notable Core Client Settings</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Disable Game Canvas</dt>
  <dd>This option, when toggled, disables the game canvas that allows for the rendering of scenes but still allows the remaining functionality of Foundry Virtual Tabletop to fully function. This is setting designed to allow for individual users with less capable computer hardware to still interact with the other aspects of Foundry Virtual Tabletop without the additional hardware requirements that the WebGL canvas involve.</dd>
  
  <dt>Language Preference</dt>
  <dd>Select a supported language which you would like to use for Foundry Virtual Tabletop. English is supported by default and other languages may be installed as Modules. If a translation module is installed any languages which it defines will appear as an option in this dropdown list.</dd>
  
  <dt>Enable Chat Bubbles</dt>
  <dd>If this setting is enabled, in-character chat messages which originate from an Actor who has a Token on the active Scene will display a chat bubble above the position of that Token for all players.</dd>
  
  <dt>Pan to Token Speaker</dt>
  <dd>If this setting is enabled, and Enable Chat Bubbles is also enabled, when a Token chat bubble is displayed the camera position of the Scene will automatically pan to the location of the speaking Token.</dd>

  <dt>Disable Pixel Resolution Scaling</dt>
  <dd>When this setting is enabled the software will automatically scale the canvas resolution to the pixel density of the display device. This results in a reduction in visual quality but an improvement in application performance for pixel high-density displays such as very large or super high resolution monitors.</dd>

  <dt id="deselect">Left-Click to Release Objects</dt>
  <dd>When set, this object allows you to release objects (deselect) on the canvas by using a single left click anywhere on the canvas, rather than the default behavior of requiring a click-and-drag in empty space.</dd>
  
  <dt id="performance-mode">Performance Mode</dt>
  <dd>This setting controls Foundry's rendering quality and can change how well the application performs on different types of hardware. More powerful systems can select high or maximum and lower-end machines can opt for low or medium.</dd>
  
  <dt id="maximum-framerate">Maximum Framerate</dt>
  <dd>Set a maximum framerate at which the Foundry Virtual Tabletop canvas will be rendered. By default the canvas renders at 60fps, but setting a lower maximum value may be helpful to limit the resource consumption of the Foundry application on less powerful machines.</dd>
  
  <dt>Show FPS Meter</dt>
  <dd>When this setting is enabled, a framerate meter will be displayed in the bottom-right of the canvas that shows how many frames per second the canvas is rendering.</dd>
  
  <dt>Font Size</dt>
  <dd>This setting allows you to globally enlarge or reduce the font size in the application.</dd>

  <dt>Token Vision Animation</dt>
  <dd>When disabled, tokens will only update their vision when they arrive at the destination of their movement, rather than as they move. Disabling this setting may offer improved performance for machines with lower-end hardware.</dd>
  
  <dt>Light Source Animation</dt>
  <dd>This setting controls whether or not light source animations render. Disabling this setting can help performance for lower-end machines.</dd>
  
  <dt>Zoomed Texture Antialiasing</dt>
  <dd>By default, FVTT uses mipmap antialiasing on sprite textures such as tiles or tokens at lower levels of zoom, if disabled, textures will appear sharper when zoomed out but can look pixelated.</dd>

  <dt>Editor Autosave Frequency</dt>
  <dd>This determines the interval in seconds before the ProseMirror text editor automatically saves changes made to a text entry.</dd>

  <dt>Combat Theme</dt>
  <dd>This setting allows you to select one of multiple premade combat themes which are randomized sound effects that play when a combat encounter begins, when your turn is next in the combat order, and when your turn begins. Selecting "None" disables this feature entirely. Additional combat themes can be added via add-on modules.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="notable-world-settings" class="border">Notable world settings</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Scrolling Status Text</dt>
  <dd>When this setting is enabled, scrolling text may appear above tokens or other canvas objects when they're changed. For example: a token who has been dealt five points of damage would show a floating '-5' before fading away.</dd>

  <dt>Token Drag Vision</dt>
  <dd>When enabled, vision and lighting for a Token is previewed in real time during a left-click drag, allowing your players to preview what their token would be able to see when moved.</dd>

  <dt>Animate Roll Tables</dt>
  <dd>If this setting is enabled, Roll Tables will display a roulette-style animation when results are drawn and the Table Configuration sheet is currently open.</dd>
  
  <dt>Cone Template Type</dt>
  <dd>Choose which template measurement style should be used for cones. Flat cones will draw a straight line between the two outer rays while rounded cones will include a radial arc based on the angle of the cone.</dd>
</dl>
