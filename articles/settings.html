<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop features a number of configurable settings which are accessed by clicking the <strong>Configure Settings</strong> button in the <strong>Settings Sidebar</strong> tab. Settings allow you to customise your FVTT experience and the way you interact with the software.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Core Settings</strong> change particular features of the software's behavior in the current world.</li>
  <li><strong>System Settings</strong> change aspects of the game system you are currently using. Options here depend on what the system allows you to change.</li>
  <li><strong>Module Settings</strong> change particular settings and customise functionality as provided by currently active add-on modules.</li>
  </ul>

<p class="note info">Note that these settings differ from the @Article[configuration] settings which are controlled by the server host.</p>

<h4 id="scopes">Setting Scopes</h4>
<p>Setting Scopes are configured by the Foundry VTT API and determine if a setting affects all users, or only the user who has made the change. Setting scopes fall under Client and World.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client Settings</strong> are saved in the browser. As a consequence, client settings will apply to all Worlds that are accessed from the same device using the same browser. <strong>Maximum Framerate</strong> is an example of a client setting. Any user, regardless of permission, can modify their own client-level settings.</li>
<li><strong>World Settings</strong> which are stored in the server-side database for the World. As a consequence, world settings only apply to a single World but are common to all Users within that World. Whether Chat Bubbles are enabled is an example of a world-level setting. By default, only a Gamemaster or User with the "Assistant Gamemaster" role can modify world-level settings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Saving Your Settings</h4>
<p>Changes to these game settings are only applied when the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button is clicked and some changes may require the browser to automatically refresh in order to take effect. All settings can be reset back to their default values by clicking the<strong>Reset Defaults</strong> button.</p>

<p>The following configurable settings are supported by the core Foundry Virtual Tabletop software on the "Core Settings" tab.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Configure Permissions</dt>
  <dd><strong>[World]</strong> Open a separate configuration menu to customize permission controls for different User roles. See the section specific to Permission Configuration below for more details.</dd>
  <dt>Configure Audio/Video</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> Foundry Virtual Tabletop supports optional configuration of Audio/Video chat integration using WebRTC. This button opens a separate dialog window for configuration of this feature. See the @Article[audio-video] guide for more details on the settings contained here.</dd>
  <dt>Default Token Configuration</dt>
  <dd><strong>[World]</strong> This button opens a separate configuration menu that allows you to customize the default settings that all tokens should have. For details on what the various options affect see the @Article[tokens] article.</dd>
  <dt>Disable Game Canvas</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> This option, when toggled, disables the game cavas that allows for the rendering of scenes but still allows the remaining functionality of Foundry Virtual Tabletop to fully function. This is setting designed to allow for individual users with less capable computer hardware to still interact with the other aspects of Foundry Virtual Tabletop without the additional hardware requirements that the WebGL canvas involve.</dd>
  <dt>Language Preference</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> Select a supported language which you would like to use for Foundry Virtual Tabletop. English is supported by default and other languages may be installed as Modules. If a translation module is installed any languages which it defines will appear as an option in this dropdown list.</dd>
  <dt>Enable Chat Bubbles</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> If this setting is enabled, in-character chat messages which originate from an Actor who has a Token on the active Scene will display a chat bubble above the position of that Token for all players.</dd>
  <dt>Pan to Token Speaker</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> If this setting is enabled, and Enable Chat Bubbles is also enabled, when a Token chat bubble is displayed the camera position of the Scene will automatically pan to the location of the speaking Token.</dd>
  <dt>Scrolling Status Text</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> When this setting is enabled, scrolling text may appear above tokens or other canvas objects when they're changed. For example: a token who has been dealt five points of damage would show a floating '-5' before fading away.</dd>
  <dt>Left-Click to Release Objects</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> When set, this object allows you to release objects (deselect) on the canvas by using a single left click anywhere on the canvas, rather than the default behaviour of requiring a click-and-drag in empty space.</dd>
  <dt>Performance Mode</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> This setting controls Foundry's rendering quality and can change how well the application performs on different types of hardware. More powerful systems can select high or maximum and lower-end machines can opt for low or medium.</dd>
  <dt>Maximum Framerate</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> Set a maximum framerate at which the Foundry Virtual Tabletop canvas will be rendered. By default the canvas renders at 60fps, but setting a lower maximum value may be helpful to limit the resource consumption of the Foundry application on less powerful machines.</dd>
  <dt>Show FPS Meter</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> When this setting is enabled, a framerate meter will be displayed in the bottom-right of the canvas that shows how many frames per second the canvas is rendering.</dd>
  <dt>Font Size</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> This setting allows you to globally enlarge or reduce the font size in the application.</dd>
  <dt>Token Drag Vision</dt>
  <dd><strong>[World]</strong> When enabled, vision and lighting for a Token is previewed in real time during a left-click drag, allowing your players to preview what their token would be able to see when moved.</dd>
  <dt>Token Vision Animation</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> When disabled, tokens will only update their vision when they arrive at the destination of their movement, rather than as they move. Disabling this setting may offer improved performance for machines with lower-end hardware.</dd>
  <dt>Light Source Animation</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> This setting controls whether or not light source animations render. Disabling this setting can help performance for lower-end machines.</dd>
  <dt>Zoomed Texture Antialiasing</dt>
  <dd><strong>[Client]</strong> By default, FVTT uses mipmap antialiasing on sprite textures such as tiles or tokens at lower levels of zoom, if disabled, textures will appear sharper when zoomed out but can look pixelated.</dd>
  <dt>Animate Roll Tables</dt>
  <dd><strong>[World]</strong> If this setting is enabled, Roll Tables will display a roulette-style animation when results are drawn and the Table Configuration sheet is currently open.</dd>
  <dt>Cone Template Type</dt>
  <dd><strong>[World]</strong> Choose which template measurement style should be used for cones. Flat cones will draw a straight line between the two outer rays while rounded cones will include a radial arc based on the angle of the cone.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="permissions" class="border">Permission Configuration</h2>
<p>Clicking on the <strong>Permission Configuration</strong> button of the settings menu allows the customization of specific permissions which can be assigned or removed from different User roles.</p>

<p class="note info">Visit the @Article[users] documentation to learn more about User roles and what they represent.</p>

<p>Each Permission can be assigned to a set of Roles which are able to perform that permission. Some permissions cannot be revoked for a Gamemaster role while others can be disabled even for Gamemaster users. The image below shows the Permission Configuration form and the list which follows describes each permission capability.</p>

<figure class="right">@Image[36] 
  <figcaption>The Permission Configuration submenu allows for fine-tuned customization of the permissions allowed to each User role.</figcaption>

<h2 id="settingsapi" class="border">API References</h2>
<p>Module and system developers have the capability to register their own settings and settings menus using the Foundry API. This involves working with the "ClientSettings" API (although this also manages world settings) to register settings and settings menus. Some examples are provided below, but see the API documentation for more detail.</p>
