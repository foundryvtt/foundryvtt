<h3>Version 13 Patreon Feature Vote</h3>
<p class="note" style="width: max-content">Thursday, May 23</p>
<p>Now that the stable release for Version 12 is available, we will begin scoping and planning for our next release of Version 13. This process will take some time, and we won't start development work immediately, but a first step in this process is to identify which major feature our community votes for us to develop. We will post an article with an array of options that are good candidates for prioritization and then members of our community who are supporters on <a href="https://patreon.com/foundryvtt" target="_blank">Patreon</a> can vote on the option that we will prioritize alongside other key v13 features.</p>

<h3>Year In Review Article</h3>
<p class="note" style="width: max-content">Friday, May 24</p>
<p>Each year as part of our anniversary celebration we post a lengthy "year in review" article that looks backwards at what we accomplished during the prior 12 months, and looks ahead towards the exciting things we plan for during the coming year. This annual article is a great way to get some insight into what we do as a company and how we do it. If you would like to read prior versions of this article you can find them here:</p>

    <li>@Article[year-in-review-2022]</li>
    <li>@Article[year-in-review-2023]</li>
</ol>
<p>This year we will have a new installment which reflects on everything we accomplished since May 2023 and introduces some new announcements that we are thrilled to share for the year ahead. Once posted, our year-in-review article will be available at <a href="article/year-in-review-2024/" target="_blank">https://foundryvtt.com/article/year-in-review-2023/</a>.</p>

<h3>Content Showcase Stream</h3>
<p class="note" style="width: max-content">Monday, May 27 at 2pm Eastern</p>
<p>One of the most-asked questions we get is "<em>what</em> are you working on next?". Usually we have to respond in an ambiguous way that acknowledges we are very busy, but this stream <em>is</em> an opportunity for us to get into exciting details! We will highlight some big content initiatives, exciting new releases, and share an <em>ember</em> of detail on some major projects. We are excited to share with you and hope you'll be able to join us live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/foundryvtt" target="_blank">twitch.tv/foundryvtt</a> or to watch the video later uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/foundrynet" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>

<h3>Reddit "Ask Us Anything"</h3>
<p class="note" style="width: max-content">Tuesday, May 28 starting at 11am Eastern</p>
<p>The team has set aside most of the day on Thursday the 28th to engage with our Reddit community on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/foundryvtt" target="_blank">r/foundryvtt</a>! We will be answering your questions throughout the day in a thread which will be posted a few hours before our time window opens. We look forward to a mix of hard-hitting and silly questions that allow us to share perspective with you.</p>


<h3>Discord "Ask Us Anything"</h3>
<p class="note" style="width: max-content">Wednesday, May 29 starting at 11am Eastern</p>
<p>As a companion to our Reddit AMA, we will be doing a similar activity on our official <a href="https://discord.gg/foundryvtt" target="_blank">Discord Server</a> throughout the day on Wednesday the 29th. This will be a second-chance to ask and have answered all the questions that we didn't get to the day prior on Reddit and to hang out with our wonderful Discord community. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<h3>Free Project Friday: Live Edition</h3>
<p class="note" style="width: max-content">Friday, May 31 at 2pm Eastern</p>
<p>We can't think of a more fitting way to close out the end of our Anniversary Celebration than with our team's monthly tradition of "Free Project Friday". Usually this is a behind-closed-doors opportunity for our team to work creatively on projects that are of personal interest to us, but this month we will be sharing our process with everyone! Each month we allow ourselves a day (more or less) to explore and develop projects which are related to Foundry Virtual Tabletop but are things that we otherwise wouldn't have time or prioritization to work on. Many of these Free Project Friday (or "FPF") contributions become new features in the core software while others never make it past the planning stage - regardless it is always a fun and creative time and our team is excited to share with you live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/foundryvtt" target="_blank">twitch.tv/foundryvtt</a> with a video of the broadcast later uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/foundrynet" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>
