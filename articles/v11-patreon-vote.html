<h2 class="border">Vote Overview</h2>
<section id="vote-intro">
<p>Welcome to the Foundry Virtual Tabletop feature vote for Version 11!</p>
<p>Version 10 was our largest version to-date, with over 1,200 issues closed across 9 months of development effort. We've grown our team, <a href="/packages/pf2e-abomination-vaults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Abomination Vaults for Pathfinder 2e">partnered with Paizo</a>, attended conventions, written a <a href="/packages/house-divided" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">brand new in-house adventure</a>, and set up our own <a href="https://foundryvtt.teemill.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Merch Shop</a> so you can showcase your Foundry VTT fandom wherever you go. If you want to read more about things we have been up to lately, check out our most recent <a href="/article/year-in-review-2022/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2022 Year-in-Review</a> article from this past May.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen the teasers for our new adventure, we've spent the last year developing a 100-plus hour adventure, <a href="/packages/house-divided" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="A House Divided">A House Divided</a>. This adventure is going to be a really special experience which showcases many of our software's most powerful and beautiful features. We are really proud of what we have created and hope you will also love it.</p>
<h3>Expectations for Version 11</h3>
<p>We are very proud of the functionality and capabilities of Version 10, but it was a very large update after a very lengthy development cycle. An important goal for our team is to provide everyone with a bit of a breather for Version 11; we are aiming for a smaller release on a shorter development cycle. The features we are considering for Version 11 are ones that we feel confident we can add without disrupting the stability of Version 10.</p>
<p>With each major version - and Version 11 is no exception - we will commit to including one major feature that is most preferred by our community. This feature is voted upon by our Patreon community and will be our primary focus in Version 11. In addition to the community-chosen feature, we will also prioritize a feature or key infrastructural improvement which we feel is most important for the software. We hope to deliver a powerful and stable Version 11 release sometime in early 2023.</p>
<h3>How the Vote Works</h3>
<p>If this is your first time voting in the Prioritization Vote, here's how it works - presented below are 8 options, along with some info on what they would entail. The winning feature will be <em>one of</em> the things we deliver in V11. Previous Patreon feature votes resulted in the addition of Active Effects (V7), Overhead Tiles (V8), Card Support (V9), and Improved Journals (V10). The choices are listed alphabetically below with some details about each option. Please pick the one feature that you would be most excited to see added to Foundry Virtual Tabletop in Version 11.</p>
<p>Feature prioritization voting is a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/foundryvtt" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Foundry Virtual Tabletop on Patreon">Patreon Membership</a> benefit available to supporters at all tiers.

<h2 class="border" id="advanced-measured-templates">1. Advanced Measured Templates</h2>
<p>Expand upon the existing Measured Templates system and add new features like template animation support, improved customization for template shapes, and the ability to link Templates to a Token.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Why you might want it</blockquote>
<p>If you've ever wanted to visually see the arc of your lightning or the blast of a fireball, animations are for you. For the more defensively minded, linking a template lets you walk around with auras. Combat can be not only more exciting but sped up with accurate template-zones based on walls, allowing you to easily target (and blow up) the right people.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Things we'll do before we call it done</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Add the ability to link a Template to a Token so that the Template moves when the Token does.</li>
<li>Improve integration with the targeting system so the placement of Templates will auto-target Tokens within its area of effect.</li>
<li>Add an API framework for rendering beautiful animations inside of Template shapes.</li>
<li>Add an option that will constrain the area of Measured Templates according to nearby walls.</li>
<li>Add support for video textures to be used for Template fills.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="question">Stretch goals we would like to accomplish if possible</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Include built-in animations for common spell types like Fireballs, Ice Blasts, Lighting Bolts, and more.</li>
<li>Add a framework to apply a visual filter or animation onto Tokens inside the Template area.</li>
<li>Other improvements related to Measured Templates and their interaction with other software components.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border" id="compendium-improvements">2. Compendium Improvements</h2>
<p>Expand the functionality of Compendiums packs to add new organizational tools and quality-of-life improvements for both Gamemasters and content creators.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Why you might want it</blockquote>
<p>We want to make it easier for users to create their own Compendium packs and organize their content in a way that is accessible across all the Worlds that they play. We can improve the organization of compendium packs by adding support for Folders. Further improvements to the Adventure document type and its associated Compendium packs can make it easier to import only a subset of specific content into your World.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Things we'll do before we call it done</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Provide a user-friendly workflow to create a Compendium pack that is shared across multiple Worlds.</li>
<li>Add support for Folder organization of the Compendium Packs sidebar tab.</li>
<li>Add support for Folder organization of Documents inside a Compendium pack.</li>
<li>Make it easier for package developers to define a custom UI component for a browsing the contents of a Compendium pack.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="question">Stretch goals we would like to accomplish if possible</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Provide a workflow for packaging a created Adventure compendium pack as a distributable Module.</li>
<li>Add more granular import options to Adventures, allowing you to import or update only some Documents</li>
<li>Other improvements related to Compendium packs and their interaction with other software components.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border" id="event-triggers">3. Event Triggers</h2>
<p>A new system which provides the possibility for defining scripted events that occur dynamically when Tokens interact with a certain area of a Scene.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Why you might want it</blockquote>
<p>If you've ever wanted to have a pressure-plate trap trigger a boulder showing up at the end of the hallway, this is the feature for you.</p>
<p>There are a huge number of use cases for Event Triggers ranging from activating a trap, revealing a hidden passageway, initiating a combat encounter, turning lights on or off, or transitioning Tokens from one area to another. The Event Triggers system will allow you to make your Scenes more immersive and engaging by adding new ways for players to interact with the environment.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Things we'll do before we call it done</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Define a new Embedded Document type inside a Scene which allows the definition of Event regions.</li>
<li>Each Event region will have its own triggering logic and scripted functionality when activated.</li>
<li>Some Event trigger types will be provided out-of-the-box, but Events can trigger Macros for almost limitless possibilities.</li>
<li>Support player-interactive control icons associated with Event regions. For example an area transition icon that - when clicked - transports a Token to a different region, or a lever control icon which - when clicked - transforms the Scene by activating certain Tiles.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="question">Stretch goals we would like to accomplish if possible</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Support "trap" type triggers to be revealed and visualized for players, allowing them to discover the location of dangerous traps.</li>
<li>Provide an advanced API framework which allows modules and systems to fine-tune the triggering conditions for an Event area.</li>
<li>Provide a way to link to Events in a Journal Entry, allowing activation of triggered Events by clicking a button in the Journal.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border" id="fog-of-war">4. Improved Fog of War</h2>
<p>Expand upon the existing Fog of War system to add improved tools for Gamemasters and a better user experience for players.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Why you might want it</blockquote>
<p>Dynamic fog-of-war is gorgeous but can feel a bit out of place when playing old-school RPG's or using black-and-white maps. The addition of tools for manual management of Fog-of-War exploration would make it easy for a GM to reveal an entire room to all players or to hide a specific area that was previously discovered. Under-the-hood performance improvements to the way we store and save Fog exploration data will improve performance across the board.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Things we'll do before we call it done</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Redesign the way that Fog of War exploration is computed and stored to improve performance with a geometry-based approach.</li>
<li>Add drawing tools which allow the Gamemaster to manually reveal or conceal parts of the Scene.</li>
<li>Further expand support for customizing the appearance of Fog of War with improvements to using custom textures and colors.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="question">Stretch goals we would like to accomplish if possible</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Add new advanced options for Fog of War exploration like blend mode, explored alpha, and other options.</li>
<li>Add support for Fog of War animation which can display the unexplored region visually like actual dense fog.</li>
<li>Add custom rendering for the edges of Fog of War which add some procedural noise to the explored region for a more organic aesthetic.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border" id="placeable-items">5. Placeable Items</h2>
<p>Allow Items to be placed directly into a Scene, unlocking the ability for Players to find and acquire treasure or plot-advancing items by interacting directly with the game Canvas.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Why you might want it</blockquote>
<p>The party enters a room dominated by a statue clutching a gleaming red gem, the legendary artifact they've been searching for. With placeable items, that gem can now exist on the map for your players to loot directly into their inventory. If your players are motivated by exploration, discovery, and the pursuit of treasure - the Placeable Items system will allow you to provide deeper engagement and immersion for the environments you create.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Things we'll do before we call it done</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Implement a new embedded Document type which allows Items to be placed within a Scene.</li>
<li>Add a new Canvas layer that contains and displays Items which are present within a Scene.</li>
<li>Placed Items can be viewed and added to Actor inventories.</li>
<li>Placed Items can have a customized appearance similar to the features offered for Tokens.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="question">Stretch goals we would like to accomplish if possible</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Provide a mechanism for a defeated Token to be "looted", thereby acquiring the items that it previously possessed.</li>
<li>Support bundles of Items together which can support cases like a Treasure Chest that contains multiple things.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border" id="player-client">6. Standalone Player Client</h2>
<p>A new installable version of the software which allows users to connect to remote Foundry instances in a client optimized specifically for Foundry VTT. The Player Client would be provided free of charge.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Why you might want it</blockquote>
<p>Connecting to Foundry via a browser can often have various browser-discrepancies that cause visual or performance issues. A dedicated client would give you an optimized way to connect to a Foundry instance, removing the need for common troubleshooting steps such as enabling Hardware acceleration. Controlling the connection also allows us to add additional guidance, such as pages that help you diagnose why you can't connect to your friend's server. As a full Application, the Player Client would have more permissions and would be able to be granted access to your microphone without need for complicated SSL setups, and would enable us to invest work into things like Discord integrations that we previously couldn't do in a browser.</p>
<p>Although we will have more control than in the browser, a Player Client would not solve networking issues such as connectivity, it will only give better information about why a connection failed.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Things we'll do before we call it done</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Offer an installable version of the Foundry Virtual Tabletop application which can be downloaded for free and provide a way to connect to game sessions hosted by other users.</li>
<li>Allow players to bookmark game servers, keeping a list of games to easily and conveniently connect to.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="question">Stretch goals we would like to accomplish if possible</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Provide a "one-click-launch" link which can be given to players to launch the Foundry Virtual Tabletop client application (if installed) and connect to a game session.</li>
<li>Allow users to store character data locally, making it easier to reuse the same character between multiple game worlds.</li>
<li>Add support for Discord Rich Presence to enable audio-only voice calls inside the Foundry VTT application using the underlying Discord GameSDK. This option would enable voice communication for self-hosted users who are not otherwise running with SSL certificates.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border" id="touch-support">7. Touch/Tablet Support</h2>
<p>Add support for touch and gesture interactions in addition to clicks. Work to make Foundry Virtual Tabletop look and feel good to use on devices with lower resolutions than are currently supported.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Why you might want it</blockquote>
<p>With more people using Foundry to play in-person, the desire to connect via a tablet or touch-enabled laptop has become more pressing. Supporting full touch would enable fingers and pens to interact with UI elements, and gesture support would enable familiar actions such as pinching to zoom. Improving how the Foundry UI scales down to smaller devices would help support this workflow as well, although it will be up to System developers to ensure their Character sheets are responsive as well. The addition of this feature would also improve the usability of Foundry VTT on touch-based devices like Gameboard.</p>
<p>Although this work will be a good stepping-stone towards mobile support, it will not bring a mobile-friendly UI and Foundry will still be difficult to use on phone-sized devices.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Things we'll do before we call it done</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Refactor our codebase to support Pointer events for interactions rather than just Click events.</li>
<li>Directly support certain multi-touch gestures like using two fingers to pan or pinch to zoom.</li>
<li>Improve the responsive design of our user interface to effectively scale down to support tablet-sized devices.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="question">Stretch goals we would like to accomplish if possible</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Explore options to vend Foundry Virtual Tabletop as a progressive web app that would run like a native application on tablets or other devices.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="border" id="ui-ux-focus">8. UI/UX Focus</h2>
<p>Many of you have expressed feedback that you would value greater refinement, polish, and stability of existing features more than you would value new features. Instead of a major feature addition, we would devote significant effort towards refinement of the UI and UX of our existing software to deliver as many small improvements to interface and user experience as possible. Please note that we will absolutely work to improve UI/UX in Version 11 even if this option is not chosen, but if this option is chosen that work will receive significantly greater investment.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Why you might want it</blockquote>
<p>If you enjoy and are excited by our recent website redesign, you may be equally excited for us to begin work on refining the UI of the core Foundry VTT application. In addition to improvements to the interface, there are a huge number of enhancements that can refine and enhance the user experience of working with the software for both Gamemasters and Players. Investments here range from improving clarity regarding how functionalities work, reducing the number of clicks to perform certain workflows, and changing our interface to be more intuitive for new and existing users.</p>
<blockquote class="question">Things we'll do before we call it done</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>An overall streamlining of workflows for interacting with all Document Types and the Canvas, reducing number of clicks required and increasing transparency about what each action does</li>
<li>Improve working with forms, particularly for specific input types like range sliders, color input fields, or file pickers.</li>
<li>Improve standardization of UI elements and UX workflows so a given action works the same place in every context.</li>
<li>Identify opportunities to add or improve keybindings to support keyboard interactions for common workflows.</li>
<li>Provide additional Tours and Tooltips to improve New User Experience.</li>
<li>Begin work on a next-generation user interface for the software - starting with the Setup and Configuration screen.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="question">Stretch goals we would like to accomplish if possible</blockquote>
<p>Instead of a specific list of stretch goals, we will instead emphasize that there are currently <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Aui%2Cux" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">376 open issues</a> on GitHub tagged with either the <code>UI</code> or <code>UX</code> labels. There is a deep well of ideas which we have for how to improve the experience of using the Foundry Virtual Tabletop software. We would seek to implement a considerable number of these suggestions.</p>
