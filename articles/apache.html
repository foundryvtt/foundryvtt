<p><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" title="Apache Web Server" title="_blank">Apache</a> is a popular web server which you may consider using as a proxy server in front of Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</p> 
<p>This is a quick tutorial that will cover how to setup a virtual server that uses Apache to proxy. There are <em>many advanced options</em> which are not covered here.</p>

<p class="note info">Please note that using a proxy server like Apache, while advantageous for dedicated web hosts, is absolutely not required in order to use Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</p>

<h3 id="host">Step 1 - Create your Virtual Host</h3>
<p>While setting up a virtual server to host Foundry is outside the scope of this tutorial, here are a few helpful pointers.</p>
<p>First, you will need to procure hosting. Fortunately, many inexpensive options are available:</p>

<p>Foundry doesn't require many resources on the server side as most of the
    processing happens within the client's browser, so the typical $5/month (or lower) plan should be plenty. If you went with Linode, here is a

<h3 id="install">Step 3 - Install Apache</h3>

<p>Start by installing Apache for your Linux distribution. Some common examples are provided below, but consult the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/install.html" title="Apache documentation" target="_blank">Apache documentation</a> for your Linux flavor.</p>

<p class="note warning">This guide assumes a basic level of familiarity with the Linux operating system and how to interface with it. If you are brand new to Linux we recommend starting with a beginner's tutorial to the Linux command line before proceeding.</p>

<h4>Ubuntu or Debian</h4>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install apache2
</code></pre>

<h4>Red Hat or CentOS</h4>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo yum update -y
sudo yum -y install httpd
</code></pre>

<h4>Amazon Linux 2</h4>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo yum update -y
sudo yum -y install httpd
</code></pre>
<hr/>

<h3 id="configure">Step 4 - Configure Apache</h3>
<p>Apache requires a configuration file which defines how the server functions. A functional starting point to begin testing Apache is the following configuration which does not use SSL certificates (we can enable those later). For the purposes of this example we assume that Foundry Virtual Tabletop is running from <code>/home/ec2-user/foundryvtt</code>, but your application installation path may be different, you should adjust the configuration file accordingly.</p>

<p class="note warning">Make sure to update the references to <code>your.hostname</code> in the configuration.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Apache .conf for reverse proxy of Foundry Virtual Tabletop.
# Requires mod_proxy mod_proxy_http mod_proxy_wstunnel for WebSocket support.
# For Ubuntu and Debian this goes in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
# For Amazon Linux, CentOS, and RHEL this goes in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName              your.hostname.com

    # Proxy Server Configuration
    ProxyPreserveHost       On
    ProxyPass "/socket.io/" "ws://localhost:30000/socket.io/"
    ProxyPass /             http://localhost:30000/
    ProxyPassReverse /      http://localhost:30000/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
# Increase the maximum upload limit Apache will allow
&lt;Location&gt;
LimitRequestBody 104857600 # 100MB upload
&lt;/Location&gt;
</code></pre>


<p>Once you have configured Apache, there are some configurations for Foundry Virtual Tabletop in the @Article[configuration] article you will also want to apply. Set the following options in your Foundry VTT <code>{userData}/Config/options.json</code> file which will instruct Foundry that the server is running with a proxy server in front of it on port 80.</p>
<p class="note info">Please be aware that if your Foundry VTT location is hosted at a subfolder location, such as <code>mysite.com/foundryvtt</code>, you will need to define a <code>routePrefix</code> as outlined in the @Article[configuration] article.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">"hostname": "your.hostname.com",
"routePrefix": null,
"sslCert": null,
"sslKey": null,
"port": 30000,
"proxyPort": 80
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have configured your reverse proxy, you will want to restart the proxy instance as well as your Foundry VTT instance to ensure that the new settings are active.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 id="control">Step 5 - Start, Stop, and Restart Apache</h3>
<p>You can use the <code>systemctl</code> utility to easily manage your Apache server.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># For Ubuntu and Debian
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl restart apache2

# For Amazon Linux, RHEL, or CentOS
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl stop httpd
sudo systemctl restart httpd
</code></pre>
<hr/>

<h3 id="ssl">Step 6 - Add SSL Certificates (Optional)</h3>
<p>For more advanced usage you can add SSL Certificates for added security. Start by creating SSL Certificates, we recommend <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/instructions" title="Certbot SSL Certificates Instructions" target="_blank">using Certbot</a>. Once your certificates are created, your Apache configuration file will be updated to use port 443 and the SSL certificates you have created.</p>

<p class="note warning">Make sure to update the references to <code>your.hostname</code> in the configuration.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Apache .conf for reverse proxy of Foundry Virtual Tabletop.
# Requires mod_proxy mod_proxy_http mod_proxy_wstunnel for WebSocket support.
# For Ubuntu and Debian this goes in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
# For Amazon Linux, Centos, and RedHat this goes in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerName              your.hostname.com

    # SSL Configuration
    SSLCertificateKeyFile   "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.hostname.com/privkey.pem"
    SSLCertificateFile      "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.hostname.com/fullchain.pem"
    Include                 /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf

    # Proxy Server Configuration
    ProxyPreserveHost       On
    ProxyPass "/socket.io/" "ws://localhost:30000/socket.io/"
    ProxyPass /             http://localhost:30000/
    ProxyPassReverse /      http://localhost:30000/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have edited the Apache configuration to include your SSL certificates, be sure to do a configuration test before restarting your server. Lastly, there are some additional configuration options for Foundry Virtual Tabletop you will also want to apply. Set the following options in your Foundry VTT <code>{userData}/Config/options.json</code> file which will instruct Foundry that the server is running with a proxy server in front of it on port 443.</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">"hostname": "your.hostname.com",
"routePrefix": null,
"sslCert": null,
"sslKey": null,
"port": 30000,
"proxyPort": 443,
"proxySSL": true
</code></pre>

<h3 id="static-files">Serving Static Files via Proxy (Not Recommended)</h3>
<p>Now that you have a proxy server available, it could be tempting to use it to serve static files instead of letting the Foundry VTT web server (express) handle this task like normal.</p>
<p>However, this is <u>not a recommended approach.</u> The performance benefits are extremely minimal, the complexity to set it up properly is significant, and the potential for problems outweighs any potential benefit.</p>
<p>Specifically, there is a high likelihood of configuring the proxy server in a way that serves Foundry's static files extremely incorrectly. Furthermore, Foundry VTT's internal logic that determines which static files to serve and where to serve them from may change from version to version without notice.</p>
