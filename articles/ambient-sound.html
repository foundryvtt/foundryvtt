<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop allows for local ambient sound effects which are activated when a player-controlled Token is moved into its area of effect. This can be useful for environmental features like a waterfall or a crackling campfire which your players will be able to hear when their Tokens are nearby.</p>

</figure>

<p>Ambient Sounds are created by navigating to the Sounds layer of the active Scene by clicking on the musical notes icon in the Scene control palette. While on the Sounds layer, you can create a new Sound by using a left-click and drag workflow to expand the area of effect (you can change it later). Once you are done dragging the Sound Configuration form will appear. You must select a sound file to play in order to complete the creation. The Sound Configuration shown in the following figure and its configuration options are explained below:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Sound Type</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Configure the type of sound emitted by this source. Ambient Sounds can either be <strong>local</strong> which are blocked by any Walls which inhibit perception or <strong>global</strong> which are always audible within their area regardless of the presence of Walls.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Audio Source</dt>
	<dd>
        <p>You must choose a path to a valid sound file which plays when Tokens are within the area of effect. Ambient Sounds always repeat on loop, so it is recommended to use a format like .webm, .wav, or .ogg which allows for seamless looping, but other audio file formats are also supported.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>X & Y Position</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The x/y coordinates for the center of the Ambient Sound area of effect give the precise location of the emitter in a scene. All newly created sounds have these fields automatically filled in based on where in the scene the sound was created. Repositioning the sound in the scene also changes these values automatically.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Sound Radius</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The radius of the area of effect for the Ambient Sound, expressed in distance units. For example, if your Scene is configured where each square represents 5ft.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Volume Easing</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This option specifies that the volume of the Ambient Sound should automatically reduce as Tokens are further from its origin (but still within the area) and increase in volume when Tokens are closer to the origin of the sound. If this option is disabled, the volume level of the Ambient Sound will be the same everywhere within the affected area.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Maximum Volume</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This slider configures the maximum volume level of the Ambient Sound at its point of origin (if easing is applied) or throughout the area (if no easing).</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Darkness Activation Range</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>These fields configure the darkness levels in which the Ambient Sound plays. The default setting of between 0 and 1 results in a sound that is always playing.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="border" id="modifying">Modifying Placed Sounds</h2>
<p>After an Ambient Sound has been created, you can edit it later by double clicking on its control icon that is visible when on the Sounds Layer. To move the position of an existing Ambient Sound you can click and drag its icon to move it. You may also use <code>CTRL+C</code> and <code>CTRL+V</code> commands to copy and paste sounds.</p>
<p>Players can control the volume level of playing Ambient Sounds using the global Ambient slider in the Playlists tab of the Sidebar.</p>
<p>Note that Ambient Sounds always loop if a Token is within their area of effect. If you are interested in one-time audio effects which play at a certain time that will be handled by the Event Trigger system, a post-release feature that is not yet added.</p>
<h4>Muting Placed Sounds</h4>
<p>Once an Ambient Sound has been created, you can mute/un-mute it by right-clicking on the icon for the emission point when on the Sounds Layer.</p>
<h4>Previewing Placed Sounds</h4>
<p>Once an Ambient Sound has been created, you can toggle the preview audio feature from the Sounds Layer tool bar. While this is toggled your mouse cursor will be treated as an actor on the canvas, allowing you to hear sounds based on where it is in the scene. This is useful for quickly checking how a scene would sound based on current ambient sound placement and settings. Please note that this toggle remains even if you switch to a new layer.</p>
