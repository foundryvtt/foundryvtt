        <p>Most interesting battlemaps aren't just featureless grids. Perhaps part of your Scene is a set of stairs, a dark cave, a magical portal to another realm, or even a dastardly trap.</p>
        <p>Scene Regions allow you to define these interesting parts of your map so that they do remarkable things or behave in certain ways. With Scene Regions, you could:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Set up “stairways”</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Scene Regions allow you to define automatic teleportation zones which your players can easily use themselves without GM intervention.</p>
                    <p>These zones can be used to replicate stairs, elevators, magical portals, or similar concepts within Foundry. This teleportation can be set up between different Scene Regions as needed, even if one is on a different Scene.</p>

                </dd>
            <dt><strong>Give “indoor” areas the properties you expect</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>You can make a building or a cave keep out the things it should, like weather and or daylight.</p>

            <dt><strong>Perform actions when the Region detects certain changes</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>As an example, when a Token enters a Scene Region, that Region can automatically pause the game or even execute a custom Macro. Combined with Foundry's powerful API, this adds the potential for nearly limitless functionality, such as powering intricate puzzles or devious traps.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="terminology">Scene Region Terminology Guide</h2>
<p>Understanding Scene Regions begins with learning a few important concepts:</p>
<section class="collapsible">
<header class="collapsible-header">Scene Region Definitions</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <div class="columns">
            <div class="column">
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Region</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>A Region, often called a “Scene Region”, represents one or more parts of a Scene that you would like to behave in a certain way.</p>
                            <p>Each Region may contain many Shapes (which all share the same Behaviors). Without at least one Shape and Behavior, a Region doesn't actually do anything.</p>
                        </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Shape</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>The geometry of a Scene Region is made out of Shapes that cover an area in the canvas, much like Drawings.</p>
                            <p>Each Shape can be rectangular, elliptical, or polygonal, and the part of the canvas that is considered to be within the Region is determined by the combination of all its Shapes. Some of these Shapes may be “holes,” which actually remove areas from the Region.</p>
                            <p>A single elevation range may be assigned to every Shape in the Scene Region. This means it is possible to go “under” or “over” a Scene Region's Shapes without traveling through them.</p>
                        </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Hole</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>A hole is a Shape, but it is considered a "negative Shape" that removes geometry from the Region instead of adding it.</p>
                        </dd>       
                    <dt><strong>Behavior</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>Behaviors are the functionality that a Scene Region can perform. Each Region can have multiple Behaviors.</p>
                        </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Event</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>An Event is a change that is related to a Region, such as a Token entering or leaving one of its Shapes.</p>
                            <p>Behaviors can “subscribe” to Events, allowing them to "trigger" when the Region detects that Event.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="creating-regions">Creating Scene Regions</h3>
<p>There are two ways to create Scene Regions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>The Scene Region Legend</strong></p>
        <p>You can use the Scene Region Legend's "Create Region" button (the <i class="fa-solid fa-plus"> </i> icon in the upper-right corner) to create a new, empty Scene Region. Because this Scene Region has no Shapes or Behaviors, it is just a placeholder until you configure it (see below).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Drawing new Shapes</strong></p>
        <p>If you have no Scene Region currently selected, using one of the Region Layer's tools that draw a new Shape ("Draw Rectangle", "Draw Ellipse", or "Draw Polygon") automatically creates a new Region to contain that Shape.<p>
        <p class="note info"><strong>Note</strong>: If a Scene Region is already selected when you draw a Shape, that Shape is automatically added to the selected Scene Region instead of creating a new one.</p>
        <p>You can deselect Scene Regions using either the Scene Region Legend or the canvas. Please note that if you do not have the "Left Click to Deselect Objects" <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/settings/"> Game Setting</a> enabled, you may need to draw an empty selection to deselect Scene Regions.</p>

</ul>

The "Create Shape from Controlled Walls" button ( <i class="fa-solid fa-plus"> </i> <i class="fa-solid fa-block-brick"> </i> ) in the upper-right of this tab allows you to easily create a Shape using that existing Wall geometry.</p>
                <p class="note info"><strong>Please Note</strong>: The controlled walls must form a complete loop.</p>

                        <p>Select ("control") the walls that contain the area that you want to add as a Shape.</p>
                        <p>You may consider adding a wall or two temporarily to form a loop. If your walls look like they close but don't, you may have small gaps in your Walls. If necessary, make sure that you are not holding the <span class="reference">SHIFT</span> key, then adjust wall endpoints to allow grid snapping to connect them perfectly.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p><strong>Click the "Create Shape from Controlled Walls" button again</strong></p>
                        <p>If your wall selection is valid, a Shape is created and added to your Scene Region. If your Wall selection is not valid, please see the previous step for tips on how to correct the issue.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>If at least one Shape is a hole, then the order of the Shapes matter. A Shape that is a hole only "punches through" the Shapes that are above it in the list of Shapes, as shown by the bottom Circle shape in the previous figure.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="behaviors">Scene Region Behaviors</h2>
<p>Behaviors are what a Scene Region actually <em>does</em>. Each Region can support multiple Behaviors, and every Shape within that region shares the same set of Behaviors. </p>
<p>The available built-in Behaviors can be leveraged to accomplish a variety of goals. Some Behaviors require Events, while others have a continuous effect on their Region.</p>

<h3 id="uuids">UUIDs and Behaviors</h3>
<p>Some Behavior types, notably the <code>Teleport Token</code> and <code>Execute Macro</code> Behaviors, need to identify a different thing that they work with. The Teleport Token behavior needs to specify which Scene Region it teleports into, and the Execute Macro button needs to specify which Macro it executes. In both cases, this is performed by providing the behavior with the UUID ("<strong>U</strong>niversally <strong>U</strong>nique <strong>ID</strong>entifier") of the thing that it links to.</p>
<figure class="center">
            <img src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_681/scene-region-uuids-combined-2024-05-30.webp" style="max-width:50%;">
    <figcaption>Two Behavior fields which require adding document UUIDs and where to find them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Looking up the UUID of any object in Foundry is the same. Simply open its Configuration Dialog and <strong>left-click</strong> the "Copy ID" button in its header to copy the UUID to the clipboard. Once you have the UUID that you want to use with your Behavior, paste it into the Behavior's configuration dialog as needed. Make sure to press the "Add Document" button ( <i class="fa-solid fa-file-plus"> </i> )!</p>
<p class="info note"><strong>Note</strong>: Remember to double-check that you clicked the "Add Document" button before closing the dialog!</p>

                    <dd>Have you ever wanted to exclude part of a scene from Global Illumination, so that the light level outside was different from the light level inside? This Behavior delivers that ability and more.</dd>
                    <dd>If the result of this Behavior makes the region dark enough, the area is no longer considered lit, even if Global Illumination is enabled on the Scene. This means that Tokens will need a source of light or a special vision mode to be able to see in this darkened area. This works exactly the same way that Global Illumination can be automatically disabled "at night": the level of darkness is checked against the Scene's Global Illumination Threshold. For more information, see the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/scenes/">Scenes article.</a></dd>
                    <dt>Suppress Weather</dt>
                    <dd>Foundry VTT allows the prevention of weather effects through the use of Tiles (much like a roof would), but you may not have a convenient tile to place. Additionally, it might not make much sense to place a tile over an area such as a magically protected zone. Adding this behavior to a Region will stop rendering weather effects inside the Region without requiring a tile.</dd>
                    <dt>Modify Movement Cost</dt>
                    <dd>Many games have rules about certain types of terrain that are faster or slower to move through compared to standard terrain. This might be an area of magic that increases or decreases movement speed, a tangle of brambles or mud pit that requires slowing down to safely navigate, or many other possible causes. The Modify Movement Cost behavior can be used to set a multiplier (from 0 to 5 in increments of 0.25) on the "cost" of movement through a scene region, artificially increasing or decreasing the distance part of the grid represents. </dd>

            <dd>This behavior can be used to display on-screen colored text in an animation when its event is triggered. The text can have its color configured, visibility limited to gamemasters or observers, and optionally may be configured to only show the first time it is triggered. </dd>

                <dd>For those Macro-hoarding GMs who already have all manner of pre-coded scripts ready to go for certain actions and just want them to trigger automatically, the Execute Macro behavior does what it says on the label: when you assign it the UUID of a given Macro (which can be gotten by right-clicking the ID button in the Macro's header), it will trigger that Macro when its Scene Region detects that one of its subscribed events occurs.</dd>
                <dd>
                    <p>If you want to write your own Macros to use, the Scene Region passes in several important values to help you:</p>

                            <p>The Event that triggered the execution of the macro. Using <code>event.data.token</code> is particularly useful, since it recontains the Token that triggered the Event (or <code>null</code> if there isn't one).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

Just draw a scene region that will pause the game whenever a token enters the region. For convenience, you can also toggle the "Once" option so it doesn't do it every single time a token passes by.</dd>          
            <dt><strong>Teleport Token</strong></dt>
                <dd>Perhaps one of the most desired features, the Teleport Token behavior allows you to instantaneously transport a token that enters the region from one region to another. Similar to Execute Macro, this behavior requires the UUID of another Scene Region to serve as a destination. The destination region can even be in a different scene!</dd>
    <dt><strong>Toggle Behavior</strong></dt>
        <dd>Have a particular behavior you only want to activate after a certain condition has been met, such as a trap that is only active after a token has stepped on its pressure plate? Toggle behavior allows you to link to the UUID of a different Behavior, enabling or disabling the linked behavior when a certain triggering event occurs.</dd>
        <dd>In the hands of even a novice coder, Scene Regions can be leveraged to create truly powerful automations.</dd>

                    <p>Often, a map may have some outdoor and indoor areas that call for the interior being naturally darker than exterior locations. An open field might give way to the entrance of a cavern, a well-lit forest might hide an abandoned house.</p>
                    <p>The Adjust Darkness behavior allows GMs to use a Scene Region to define areas that are either darker or lighter than the rest of the scene.</p>
                    <p>To replicate the darkening effect we use in the screenshot to the right, you would:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a new scene region with a shape that matches the confines of the area you wish to darken.</li>
                        <li>Assign that region a new behavior: "Adjust Darkness Level"</li>
                        <li>Give that behavior the mode: "Override"</li>
                        <li>Set the darkness level to your preferred level, typically a darkness level of 1 is used for full darkness.</li>
                        <li>Optionally choose to blur the darkness level at its edges.</li>
                        <li>Update your region behavior and scene region to save your changes, and anyone venturing from outside the region into it will no longer be able to see as if Global Illumination is enabled.</li>

                    <p>Many game systems have rules about moving through spaces that might be slow to navigate, typically this just adds a multiplier to the amount of movement 'cost' it takes to move through that space. Suppose you have an area of a battlefield that is strewn with deep mud, making it arduous to cross. Using the "Modify Movement Cost" region behavior, you can mark that part of your scene to specify how hard it is to move through it.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a new scene region with a shape that matches the confines of the area you wish to limit.</li>
                        <li>Assign that region a new behavior: "Modify Movement Cost"</li>
                        <li>Set the slider to indicate how much the cost of movement should be multiplied by when passing through this region - setting it to 2 will double the cost of movement (so 5ft becomes 10ft), and will proportionally slow the animation of token movement.</li>
                        <li>Update your region behavior and scene region to save your changes, and now any token crossing this part of your scene will be slowed down!</li>

                    <p>Creating a user-navigable stairway is quite possibly the simplest example of a Teleport Token behavior, allowing for players to simply step into a scene region to initiate a movement of their token either to another part of a scene, or to another scene entirely. A scene region configured with Teleport Token requires an additional region to serve as a "landing" for where the token will come out when it is teleported. Setting up a scene region for stairs is a super easy, two-stage process!</p>
                    <h4>Stage 1 - Stick The Landing</h4>
                    <p>Find the part of your map where tokens will land when they've been teleported, this could be the landing at the top of a flight of stairs. Always make sure to leave enough room for more than one token to emerge, and if you plan to allow 'return trips', make sure you leave space to place a future region shape to handle that return.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a new region shape for your landing.</li>
                        <li>Get the UUID for your region shape - this universal identifier is how you point your teleporter to this region. You can get it conveniently by left-clicking the <i class="fa-solid fa-passport">&nbsp;</i> Copy Document UUID button in the header of the configuration window for your scene region.</li>
                        <li>Paste that UUID somewhere you can easily access it later.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Stage 2 - Mark the stairs</h4>
                    <p>Unlike the landing for your teleporter, the entry to the teleporter only really needs to be big enough to encompass the space a token would need to enter, this could be a single grid space at the top of a narrow stair, or as wide as the top of a grandiose ramp allowing multiple tokens to enter side by side.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a new region shape in the space you'd like players to enter in order to teleport to the top of the stairs.</li>
                        <li>Configure the scene region with the behavior: Teleport Token</li>
                        <li>In the "Destination" field, paste the UUID you copied in stage 1 and click the "Add Document" button to be sure it is committed to the configuration.</li>
                        <li>Optionally, you may click "Allow Choice" to give users a small dialog prompt asking if they would like to teleport before the teleportation occurs when they move into the region.</li>
                        <li>That's it, click update region behavior and you have successfully configured a stairway teleporter!</li>

                    <p>Using Scene Regions, you can easily create a simple yet flavorful and effective trap using two built-in functions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#behaviors-tab">Pause Game</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Simply create a new Scene Region with a Shape where the trap is and add these two behaviors. For simplicity and to avoid building a custom macro or script, you can then apply damage and give your players a chance to save themselves without needing to build it into the Scene Region itself.</p>
                    <p>Just add the Toggle Pause and Display Scrolling Text behaviors and link them both to the <a href="#events">Token Animates In</a> event. You may want to consider setting both behaviors to only execute once also, either for convenience or to indicate that the trap has now been "set off".</p>

            </figure> 
                    <p>If you're willing to be a bit fancier, more impressive traps are also possible.</p>
                    <p>Picture the moment your players are rustling around in some ancient tomb and they uncover a hidden doorway, beyond which a steeply sloped stone surface leads off into the darkness, water rushing over it. You want them to be able to choose to step onto the path- but once they've stepped on, you don't want them stepping off, and you certainly don't want them trying to climb back up it- this is a one-way journey.</p>
                    <p>Sure, we could use a simple teleport region with a destination at the bottom and no return, but where would the fun be in that? We want our players to show up at a random location in a patch of terrain at the bottom of the slide, and any attempt to climb back up should put them back at the bottom. </p>
                    <p>Before we can do anything else, we need to first establish an area where our players will land, which if we assume you are working with a scene using a square grid, you can do that with a few simple steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place a temporary placeholder token in the upper-left grid space where you would like a token to land. </li>
                        <li>With the token positioned in the first landing location, double right-click to open the token configuration and view the X-Y coordinates for that token's location. Write those coordinates down somewhere, you'll need them.</li>  
                        <li>Now, since we know the coordinates for the upper leftmost corner where the token can land, we need to know how many spaces we want the tokens to <strong>land in</strong>. Count the number of spaces to the right of your token for the area you would like to have tokens land, that will determine our new X coordinates. Do the same with spaces below the token- that will determine the new Y coordinates.</li>
                        <li>Check your Scene Configuration - in the grid tab, the grid-size in pixels determines how many pixels we need to add to our number of grid spaces.</li>
                        <li>Now, we will bring all the numbers together. Using the image to the right as an example, if Akra is located at X2300, Y2200, and we would like our possible spaces of landing to be any of the spaces to the right or bottom of the chart, we would form two lists: </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>xcoord = [2300, 2400]</em></li>
                            <li><em>ycoord = [2200, 2300, 2400]</em></li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>This means that we have two columns of grid spaces, each containing three spaces where a character may land.</li>
                        <li>Next, we create a region on the scene, and add a shape that covers the space of our slide— but not its landing.</li>
                        <li>Finally, we set the behavior to "execute script" with the subscribed event "Token Enters". We need to write a little bit of JavaScript to handle the slide:</li>
                        
                        <pre>
                            <code class="language-javascript hljs" data-highlighted="yes">//your chosen x coordinates go here
const Xcoord = [2300,2400] 
//your chosen y coordinates go here
const Ycoord = [2200,2300,2400] 
//this randomizes the X coordinate from the available options
let randX = Math.floor(Math.random() * Xcoord.length)
//this randomizes the Y coordinate from the available options
let randY = Math.floor(Math.random() * Ycoord.length) 
//this updates the coordinates of any token that enters the region shape,
//using the random coordinates you provided
await event.data.token.update({x:Xcoord[randX], y:Ycoord[randY]})</code>
                        </pre>

                            <li>After that has been configured, clicking Update Region Behavior will save this script and, after that, any token that moves into the defined region shape will immediately be moved to one of the grid spaces you chose!</li>
                    </ol>
