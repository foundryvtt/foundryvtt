</figure>

<p>This May we're celebrating the fifth anniversary of the release of Foundry Virtual Tabletop in 2020. We love being able to take the time to look back and take stock of just how far things have come and how much has changed, for the Foundry VTT software and for us as a company. We're very happy to be able to mark this special occasion with special events, behind-the-curtain peeks at our projects, and of course, our anniversary sale. We hope everyone in the community will join us in marking this milestone and that our scheduled events offer a little something for everyone.</p>

    <h3>Version 14 Patreon Feature Vote</h3>
     <p class="note" style="width: max-content">Thursday, May 22 - <a href="https://patreon.com/foundryvtt" target="_blank">On Patreon</a></p>
    <p>With Version 13 Stable now firmly in community hands, we've already begun figuring out what we'll do in V14. While the planning stage for a new version always takes some time and we're not intending to launch immediately into development for V14, one thing we always take the time to do is poll our community for which major feature we should prioritize this version.</p><p> We will post an article outlining what concepts we have for the community to vote on this time around, and simultaneously the poll will be made available to our community members who support us on <a href="https://patreon.com/foundryvtt" target="_blank">Patreon</a> so that their votes can be counted for which feature we will prioritize alongside our other planned changes for V14. As always, the listed features on these votes tend to change each Version, with some returning and others disappearing for a short time, so if your favorite feature from the last poll is missing, don't worry! It may return for the next one.</p>

        <h3>Livestream: Unboxing V13</h3>
        <p class="note" style="width: max-content">2PM EDT, Friday, May 23  - <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/foundryvtt" target="_blank">On Twitch</a></p>
        <p>Since Version 13 development is now settling into a maintenance cycle, we think it's a good time to take a look back at the development of Version 13. We hope you'll join us as we walk through the battery of features and changes that we've made since V12, and reminisce about the development process, the back-and-forth discussion, and the challenges we faced while working on V13.</p>

    <h3>Article: Year in Review Fifth Anniversary Edition</h3>
    <p class="note" style="width: max-content">Monday, May 26</p>
    <p>Each year as part of our anniversary celebration we write a comprehensive "year in review" article where we take the time to reflect on what we've accomplished during the previous 12 months. This article is perhaps one of the most important pieces of writing to us as a team and a company because it gives us a much needed break and allows us to take the time to look back on all that we have achieved and how far we've come, while turning a hopeful eye to future planning. If this is the first year in review article you've read, it's a great way to get some insight into exactly what we do as a team and how we do it. If you would like to read prior versions of this article you can find them here:</p>

        <p>Brutal. Unforgiving. Punishing. Fun.  Atropos and members of our core software, content creation, and Ember teams have elected to throw caution to the wind and sacrifice their own sanity by diving into the Tomb of Annihilation on a livestream designed for your entertainment. Come and watch as they suffer through extreme encounters and speculate on the funniest and most dramatic ways their characters may die.</p>

        <p class="note" style="width: max-content">Wednesday, May 28 - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT" target="_blank">On Reddit</a></p>
        <p>We recognize that our unofficial Reddit community on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/foundryvtt" target="_blank">r/foundryvtt</a> is a second home for our users, and this will mark the fifth year that we've hosted an AMA there. We love being able to engage with the community and share personal stories and insights into Foundry VTT. </p><p>We will be answering your questions throughout the day in a thread which will be posted a few hours before the time window opens in order to really get the most out of the discussion for our international community. We look forward to a mix of hard-hitting and silly questions that allow us to share perspective with you, but we ask that any tech support questions be kept to our community discord instead.</p>

        <h3>Livestream: Free Project Friday LIVE</h3>
        <p class="note" style="width: max-content">12PM EDT, Friday, May 30 - <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/foundryvtt" target="_blank">On Twitch</a></p>
        <p>The Foundry VTT team has a monthly tradition of "Free Project Friday". Usually this is a behind-closed-doors opportunity for our team to work creatively on projects that are of personal interest to us, but this month we will be sharing our process with everyone!</p>
        <p>Each month we allow ourselves a day (more or less) to explore and develop projects which are related to Foundry Virtual Tabletop but are things that we otherwise wouldn't have time or prioritization to work on. Many of these Free Project Friday (or "FPF") contributions become new features in the core software while others never make it past the planning stage - regardless it is always a fun and creative time and our team is excited to share with you live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/foundryvtt" target="_blank">twitch.tv/foundryvtt</a>.</p>
