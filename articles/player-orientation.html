<h2 class="border" id="joinsession">Joining a Game Session</h2>
<figure class="right"><img alt="Getting Started - Join Session" src="https://foundryvtt.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/website-media-dev/user_1294/screen/getting-started-join-session-2021-01-22.jpg"/>
<figcaption>From this screen you can select your user, enter your password, and join a game session.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To join a game session once your gamemaster has set up and launched the world, you only need to point your web browser at the server address your GM has provided you.</p>
<p>Once there, you should see a login screen, and have a list of user names to select. After selecting your username, you can enter a password (if necessary) and join the session.</p>
<p>After a brief period of connection and loading you will be brought to the session's current active scene, and be able to begin interacting with the game.</p>
<p>If this is the first time you've joined the game, you may be faced with the player configuration window, which is detailed below.</p>
<h3>Player Configuration</h3>
<figure class="right"><img alt="Getting Started - Player Config Menu" src="https://foundryvtt.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/website-media-dev/user_1294/screen/getting-started-player-config-menu-2021-01-22.jpg"/>
<figcaption>From this screen you can select your avatar, player color, and claim a character that's been granted to you by a game master.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you first join a game session you'll be presented with the player configuration screen, here you'll select your user color which affects your cursor color, the color of your ruler, and other small aesthetic features. You'll also set your avatar, if you like. To enter this menu again once you've closed it, you simply need to right click on your name in the user list, and select Player Configuration.</p>
<h4>Choosing Your Character</h4>
<p>As a player, your game master will probably create and assign to you a character. When you first join a game session and get the initial player configuration screen, you may see one or more characters listed for you to claim. Once you claim a character their name will be appended to your user name, and that character will be under your control in scenes.</p>
<p>To change characters, you simply need to reopen the player configuration screen, and select the new character you want.</p>
<p>If you have not been granted ownership of any characters, then there will be no characters listed for you to choose.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="yourcharacter">Your Character Sheet</h2>
<figure class="right"><img alt="Getting Stated - Player Actor Directory" src="https://foundryvtt.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/website-media-dev/user_1294/screen/getting-stated-player-actor-directory-2021-01-22.jpg"/>
<figcaption>The Actors Directory will list any characters that you own or have the ability to observe.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you have ownership of a character you'll likely want to access the related character sheet to review and edit its details. To find your owned characters you will need to click on the Actors Directory in the right sidebar.</p>
<p>From here you will find a list of all actors that you have the ability to control or see, depending on the access your game master has granted you.</p>
<p>To view a character you only need to click on their name in the list to open the character sheet.</p>
<p>Making edits to a character sheet you own can be done while the scene is open. Most of the entries on the character sheet automatically updated when changed, though depending on the system being used, some may require you to commit changes with the click of a save button.</p>
<h2 class="border" id="movement">Navigating a Scene</h2>
<p>Once you have a character token placed into an active scene you're likely going to want to move that character around to explore the area. Moving a token can be done in several ways, depending on what is easiest for you.</p>
<p>Moving a token can be done in several ways, depending on what you and your players need, and what is easiest for you:</p>
<section class="collapsible"><header class="collapsible-header">Drag &amp; Drop Movement</header>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>Click and drag a token to move it in a straight line along the path to a new location. As soon as you release the token Foundry will execute the move. It should be noted that as a gamemaster you can drag tokens through walls and other obstructions, but players cannot.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="collapsible"><header class="collapsible-header">Keyboard Movement</header>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>The arrow or WASD keys can be used to move a controlled actor around a scene. This is especially useful for doing small, incremental moves in tight spaces where walls and terrain might block movement. You can also hold down Shift while using these movement keys to quickly rotate an actor to a particular facing without changing their position on the map.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="collapsible"><header class="collapsible-header">Ruler Movement</header>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>The measurement tools can be used to to move tokens. This is done quickly holding down the control (CMD for macOS) key, then clicking and dragging in a direction from a token you control. This will show you a path, and distance to the final location. You can left click in additional places along the route to place waypoints the token will follow. To move a token using this method, simply press the spacebar, and Foundry will move the token along the line to the final measured point. You can do the same thing with the measure distance tool if the start of the measurement is on a token you control.</p>
</div>
</section>
<p>It should be noted that you cannot move tokens through walls and other obstructions that the game master has created, and you'll receive a notice if you attempt to do so.</p>

<h3>The Token HUD</h3>

<figcaption>The Token HUD appears when a right-click is performed on any token you own.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If your character has been placed on the canvas as a token, you gain access to a number of quick actions you can perform as a Heads Up Display that you can view by right clicking on your token at any time.</p>
<section class="collapsible"><header class="collapsible-header">Token HUD Elements</header>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<dl>
<dt>Resource Bars</dt>
<dd>If configured by your GM, these bars provide a visual representation of resource attributes (most often for tracking HP or MP)</dd>
<dt>Resource Bar Inputs</dt>
<dd>Are used to change the value of the displayed resource bars.</dd>
<dt>Status Effects</dt>
<dd>This allows you to assign status effects to your character, and are defined by whichever Game System you are currently playing.</dd>
<dt>Elevation</dt>
<dd>This provides a simple height indicator label that will appear overlaid on your token to show their current elevation. This does not affect token vision at this time.</dd>
<dt>Target</dt>
<dd>Clicking this indicates to the GM that you are targeting yourself (or another token you control). To target tokens you don't control, you can quickly double right click to mark them as a target or use the targeting tool from the Basic Controls layer.</dd>
<dt>Toggle Combat</dt>
<dd>If there is an active combat, clicking this button will place your token in the combat tracker.</dd>
