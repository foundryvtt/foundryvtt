<p>One of Foundry Virtual Tabletop's greatest assets is its supportive community. Some dedicated and enthusiastic members of that community want to help spread our brand and show off their work.</p>

<h2>Foundry Branding</h2>
<p>In order to help the community use our branding in their own content, we thought we should offer some best practices for doing so. </p>
    
<h3>Using the Foundry Virtual Tabletop Name</h3>
<p>When creating projects related to Foundry Virtual Tabletop, it can be a bit of a mouthful to use the entire name of the program every time it is mentioned. In order to make it clear whether you are talking about Foundry Gaming LLC. (the company) or Foundry (the Virtual Tabletop software), it is best to avoid shoretening the name to Foundry. When shortening the name of the software, "Foundry VTT"; or "FVTT" should be used instead of just "Foundry". </p>

<strong>Can I use "Foundry Virtual Tabletop" in the title of my project?</strong>
<p>In short: no. It has too much potential to lead to confusion and cause people to think that your project is something officially released by Foundry Gaming LLC. Wherever possible you want to avoid people thinking we made your project. </p>

<h2>Community Content Kit</h2>
<p>We have created a few brand-labelled assets to help the community spread our brand and showcase their content. The Community Content Kit contains four transparent logos using some of our branding specifically designed to give our community a way to show that their content is intended for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, all while keeping it unofficial.</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>While we want to allow members of the community to use our branding, we'd like to ask that the content using these images follow a few simple requirements:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Please do not use the Community Content Kit in a way that suggests Foundry endorses or is in any way responsible for anything you created. We want to be sure that no one thinks the awesome content you made is something that <strong>we</strong> created or paid you to create. Your content is your own. </li>
<li>Please do not use the logos from the Community Content Kit to suggest that we have verified or examined your content.</li>
<li>Please do not modify the files contained in the Community Content Kit. If you have suggestions for changes or additional styles we could release, please <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">contact us</a> instead. However, this does not prevent you from embedding these images in larger compositions such as website or stream banners, book covers, or screenshots.</li>
