<p>Welcome to the poll for Patreon subscribers. We regularly post these in order to give the community the opportunity to make your voices heard with regard to prioritization for new features as we advance into the software. While this vote pertains to prioritization for Version 12, it is worth taking the time to discuss a couple of housekeeping items, including something we intend to do before we begin work on Version 12.</p>
<h2 class="border" id="version-11-5-intermezzo">Version 11.5 - Intermezzo</h2>
<p>Before beginning work on Version 12, we plan a slight deviation from our normal development process. The process (both good and bad) of updating to Version 11 has given us more feedback highlighting ways that we can make this process smoother and safer for users. We are going to work on an iteration of the Foundry VTT software represents an intermediate update between Version 11 and Version 12, "V11.5", if you will. This update will invest into two features:</p>
<h3 class="border" id="pre-update-compatibility-check">Pre-update Compatibility Check âœ…</h3>
<p>We will expand and enhance the software update check with a utility that examines your currently installed game systems and modules and provides a list of their compatibility status with the updated software version that you are considering to install. This will allow users to understand - before downloading an update - what the compatibility of their systems and modules will be. This interface will differentiate between packages which are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Already compatible with the new version</li>
    <li>Not compatible, but with a compatible upgrade available</li>
    <li>Not compatible, without any compatible upgrade available</li>
</ol>
<p>We believe this enhancement will improve transparency and awareness around the update process and help users to make the right decision about when they should update. We will not be back-porting this feature to V10 or any older generation, so we want to do this work as part of "V11.5" so it can be useful when the time comes for users to update from V11 to V12 (or later).</p>
<h3 class="border" id="in-place-backups">Built-In Backups</h3>
<p><img src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_70/backup-bear-2023-06-16.webp" style="float: right; max-width: 230px;" /></p>
<p>When updating Foundry Virtual Tabletop, our most frequent and most important piece of advice to users is to back up relevant user data to protect yourself and preserve the opportunity to downgrade back to the previous version of the software which you were using. We have observed that, without an easy tool for creating and managing backups, users may choose to skip this step. We never want to be in the position of telling someone "you can't go back to how things were before" - so we are going to build a tool that makes it easy to capture backups and restore data from a backup.</p>
<p>You will be able to backup your worlds, either individually or in bulk, and take a 'snapshot' of all your packages before you perform a major version updated. These backups will be stored in a separate data location. We will provide an interface that allows you to see your available backups and restore them, or rollback your entire installation to how it was before you updated Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</p>
<p>These two features are intended to make the process of updating Foundry Virtual Tabletop more transparent and more safe to ensure that everyone can enjoy the awesome new features we will deliver in V12 (and beyond) without unintentionally passing a point-of-no-return. Our team hopes that you are excited by the potential for "V11.5" as a bonus expansion of Foundry Virtual Tabletop before we begin work on Version 12.</p>
<h2 class="border">Version 12 Feature Vote</h2>
<p>We are changing the process of the Version 12 Feature Prioritization vote this time. We regret that Patreon does not offer support for ranked choice voting, and we understand the frustration that the prior implementations of our poll allowing each user a single vote create some adverse voting incentives. For the Version 12 feature vote we are going to experiment with a multiple-choice poll which allows you to vote for as many options as you wish. Please cast a vote for any options which are ones you would be happy to see prioritized in Foundry Virtual Tabletop version 12.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The winning feature will be the one which obtains the most votes overall by the time the poll closes.</strong></p>
<h3 class="border" id="advanced-measured-templates">1. Advanced Measured Templates</h3>
<figure><img alt="Advanced Measured Templates Sample" src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_70/advanced-measured-templates-sample-2023-06-15.webp" />
    <figcaption>For Visualization Purposes Only</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An expansion of the existing Measured Templates system and add new features like template animation support, improved customization for template shapes, and the ability to link Templates to a Token.</p>
<p>If you've ever wanted to visually see the arc of your lightning or the blast of a fireball, animations are for you. For the more defensively minded, linking a template lets you walk around with auras. Combat can be not only more exciting but sped up with accurate template-zones based on walls, allowing you to easily target (and blow up) the right people.</p>
<blockquote>Things that this feature would include:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Support attaching a Template to a Token so that the Template moves along with the Token.</li>
    <li>Improve integration with the targeting system so the placement of Templates can auto-target Tokens within its area of effect.</li>
    <li>Add an API framework for rendering beautiful animations inside of Template shapes.</li>
    <li>Add an option that will constrain the area of Measured Templates according to nearby walls.</li>
    <li>Add support for video textures to be used for Template fills.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Additional stretch goals we would like to accomplish:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Improve the classification of Token disposition to better allow identification of "friends" and "foes".</li>
    <li>Include built-in animations for common spell types like Fireballs, Ice Blasts, Lighting Bolts, and more.</li>
    <li>Add a framework to apply a visual filter or animation onto Tokens inside the Template area.</li>
    <li>Other improvements related to Measured Templates and their interaction with other software components.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="border" id="dynamic-soundscapes">2. Dynamic Soundscapes</h3>
<p>Provide tooling to configure a dynamic audio soundscape using a collection of input audio files, smoothly transitioning between them in ways that mask the common repetition of looping audio files.</p>
<p>Building a unique soundscape for scenes can add a new level of memorability for your players. This feature would expand on the existing playlist system.</p>
<blockquote>Things that this feature would include:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Implement a new type of Playlist which allows the composition of a dynamic soundscape from the individual Sounds included in that playlist.</li>
    <li>Configuration of the soundscape will be able to fine tune the looping, timing, duration, and randomization of each individual sound.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Additional stretch goals we would like to accomplish:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Allow organizing sounds inside the soundscape composition within groups that have certain shared timing properties.</li>
    <li>Provide an option for placed Ambient Sound objects to play an entire Playlist instead of just a single sound file.</li>
    <li>Improve our API framework surrounding the Web Audio API to provide more ergonomic use cases of audio containers for developers working on audio modules.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="border" id="environmental-animation-effects">3. Environmental Animation Effects</h3>
<figure><img alt="Animated Effects" src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_70/animated-effects-2023-06-15.webp" />
    <figcaption>For Visualization Purposes Only</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This would provide the ability for GMs to define a custom visual effect in a certain region without relying specifically on lighting. These effects could have custom defined areas but would not generate illumination or contribute towards Fog of War exploration.</p>
<p>The use of animation effects for light sources has proven to be a beneficial way to bring new life to scenes. By applying special animation to rivers and ponds you can make it look like they are moving, or use a large swirling fog animation to make it appear as though clouds are moving above the map. However, the use of animation sources on lights provide vision for tokens, and we think it would be great if there was a way to provide these animations without needing to provide light and vision.</p>
<blockquote>Things that this feature would include:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Implement a new embedded Document type within the canvas similar to Ambient Lights, which can be used to provide local environmental effects.</li>
    <li>Provide an assortment of special effects which can be used within these regions, adding to the current set of animations that are available for light sources.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Additional stretch goals we would like to accomplish:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Support defining such effects using custom polygon shapes instead of being limited to only "point sources".</li>
    <li>Extend this support to also allow for defining a custom polygon area for Ambient Light and Ambient Sound objects.</li>
</ol>
<figure><a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice" rel="nofollow" title="The Spectrum Dice Set Included in Dice So Nice"><img class="noborder" src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_70/spectrum-dice-2023-06-16.webp" /></a></figure>
<h3 class="border" id="event-triggers">4. Event Triggers</h3>
<p>A new system which provides the possibility for defining scripted events that occur dynamically when Tokens interact with a certain area of a Scene. If you've ever wanted to have a pressure-plate trap trigger a boulder showing up at the end of the hallway, this is the feature for you.</p>
<p>There are a huge number of use cases for Event Triggers ranging from activating a trap, revealing a hidden passageway, initiating a combat encounter, turning lights on or off, or transitioning Tokens from one area to another. The Event Triggers system will allow you to make your Scenes more immersive and engaging by adding new ways for players to interact with the environment.</p>
<blockquote>Things that this feature would include:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Define a new Embedded Document type inside a Scene which allows the definition of Event regions.</li>
    <li>Each Event region will have its own triggering logic and scripted functionality when activated.</li>
    <li>Some Event trigger types will be provided out-of-the-box, but Events can trigger Macros for almost limitless possibilities.</li>
    <li>Support player-interactive control icons associated with Event regions. For example an area transition control that transports the party to a different region, or a mechanical control which transforms the Scene by activating certain Tiles.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Additional stretch goals we would like to accomplish:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Support "trap" type triggers to be revealed and visualized for players, allowing them to discover the location of dangerous traps.</li>
    <li>Provide an advanced API framework which allows modules and systems to fine-tune the triggering conditions for an Event area.</li>
    <li>Provide a way to link to Events in a Journal Entry, allowing activation of triggered Events by clicking a button in the Journal.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="border" id="improved-fog-of-war">5. Improved Fog of War</h3>
<figure><img alt="Simple Fog Sample" src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_70/simple-fog-sample-2023-06-15.webp" />
    <figcaption>For Visualization Purposes Only</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Expand upon the existing Fog of War system to add improved tools for Gamemasters and a better user experience for players. Dynamic fog-of-war is gorgeous but can feel a bit out of place when playing old-school RPG's or using black-and-white maps. The addition of tools for manual management of Fog-of-War exploration would make it easy for a GM to reveal an entire room to all players or to hide a specific area that was previously discovered.</p>
<blockquote>Things that this feature would include:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Add drawing tools which allow the Gamemaster to manually reveal or conceal parts of the Scene.</li>
    <li>Further expand support for customizing the appearance of Fog of War with improvements to using custom textures and colors.</li>
    <li>Provide support for automatically revealing fog based on grid units, to support revealing hexes around a token.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Additional stretch goals we would like to accomplish:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Add new advanced options for Fog of War exploration like blend mode, explored alpha, and other options.</li>
    <li>Add support for Fog of War animation which can display the unexplored region visually like actual dense fog.</li>
    <li>Add custom rendering for the edges of Fog of War which add some procedural noise to the explored region for a more seamless aesthetic.</li>
</ol>
<figure><a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice" rel="nofollow" title="The Prism Dice Set Included in Dice So Nice"><img class="noborder" src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_70/prism-dice-2023-06-16.webp" title="The Prism Dice Included By Default in Dice So Nice" /></a></figure>
<h3 class="border" id="placeable-items">6. Placeable Items</h3>
<p>Allow Items to be placed directly into a Scene, unlocking the ability for Players to find and acquire treasure or plot-advancing items by interacting directly with the game Canvas.</p>
<p>The party enters a room dominated by a statue clutching a gleaming red gem, the legendary artifact they've been searching for. With placeable items, that gem can now exist on the map for your players to loot directly into their inventory. If your players are motivated by exploration, discovery, and the pursuit of treasure - the Placeable Items system will allow you to provide deeper engagement and immersion for the environments you create.</p>
<blockquote>Things that this feature would include:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Implement a new embedded Document type which allows Items to be placed within a Scene.</li>
    <li>Add a new Canvas layer that contains and displays Items which are present within a Scene.</li>
    <li>Placed Items can be viewed and added to Actor inventories.</li>
    <li>Placed Items can have a customized appearance similar to the features offered for Tokens.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Additional stretch goals we would like to accomplish:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Support bundles of Items together which can support cases like a Treasure Chest that contains multiple things.</li>
    <li>Integrate placeable items with Detection Modes to allow certain items to be invisible or hidden from view and only reveal under certain conditions.</li>
</ol>
<figure><a href="https://therollsmith.com/product/iridescent-rainbow-dice-set/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Free Iridescent Dice Set to Celebrate Pride from The Rollsmith"><img class="noborder" src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_70/iridescent-dice-2023-06-16.webp" /></a></figure>
<h3 class="border" id="scene-types-and-transitions">7. Scene Types and Transitions</h3>
<p>Provide a scene configuration which formalizes the concept of scene types, offering support for Battle Map, Region Map, and Vignette scenes.</p>
<p>Provide some special functionalities for each scene type. Specialize the Vignette type for theater-of-the-mind storytelling. Add custom transition animations when switching between Scenes.</p>
<p>Not every scene is a battle map, and with more users configuring scenes to display art as vignettes for theatre-of-the-mind play, or special scenes for larger regions, this feature would provide special utilities to facilitate using scenes for different types of storytelling.</p>
<blockquote>Things that this feature would include:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Expand Scene configuration to differentiate between different types of Scenes, each of which could have different behaviors when rendered on the canvas.</li>
    <li>Provide built-in Scene options for region map, area map, and vignette.</li>
    <li>Add a framework to support animated scene transitions with animation times like "fade", "wipe", or even transition animations using more advanced shaders.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Additional stretch goals we would like to accomplish:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Add additional quality-of-life features for vignette scenes that are specifically designed to use a piece of artwork as the backdrop for theater-of-the-mind gameplay.</li>
    <li>Add limited support for visual novel style interaction in vignette scenes that modules could further build upon and extend.</li>
</ol>
<figure><a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice" rel="nofollow" title="The Toxic Dice Set Included in Dice So Nice"><img class="noborder" src="https://r2.foundryvtt.com/website-uploads-public/screen/user_70/toxic-dice-2023-06-16.webp" title="The Toxic Dice Included By Default in Dice So Nice" /></a></figure>
<h3 class="border" id="terrain-and-cover">8. Terrain and Cover</h3>
<p>Allow for the definition and configuration of areas within Scenes that can be interpreted as different types of terrain, making certain regions count as more grid units for the purposes of movement. In addition, allow configuration options for Walls which could be used to annotate individual walls as providing Cover of a certain type.</p>
<p>Many game systems include concepts of different types of terrain which may be easier or more difficult for characters to move through. This feature would provide native support for defining those regions on the canvas and provide integration opportunities allowing game systems for Foundry VTT to customize how token movement is handled within specific region types. Likewise, concepts of Cover exist in numerous game systems (particularly ones with emphasis on tactical combat), by annotating walls to provide different types of cover it would allow game systems to more accurately represent the handling of cover mechanics.</p>
<blockquote>Things that this feature would include:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Extend Scene data with the capability to define regions of Terrain.</li>
    <li>Provide an API framework allowing game systems to utilize this terrain data to make decisions about how to handle Token movement or other aspects of combat automation.</li>
    <li>Enhance the Wall data model to allow defining a type of cover (if any) that a wall provides. Enhance the API for collision checks to report on the type of cover, if any, that was encountered as part of the collision test.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Additional stretch goals we would like to accomplish:</blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>Allow defined Terrain regions to contribute to the defined Scene Weather mask.</li>
</ol>
