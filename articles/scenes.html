<p>Scenes represent the areas of a World that the players may explore. Scenes may depict a variety of settings ranging from world or regional maps all the way down to small buildings or dungeons. At each point in time, one Scene is classified as the <strong>active</strong> scene. The same scene is active for all users. For each individual user a different Scene may be treated as the <strong>viewed</strong> scene, which is the area currently rendered on the game canvas for that user.</p>

<h2>Scene Configuration</h2>
<p>The Scene configuration menu allows you to customize the structure and appearance of each area within your world. This configuration is displayed automatically when a new Scene is created, but can always be accessed by left-clicking on the Scene in the sidebar directory, or by right clicking on the Scene in the top navigation bar and selecting <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>

<figure>
	@Image[6]
	<figcaption>The Scene configuration sheet contains many important options. Each supported configuration option is described on this page.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The fields which you can customize while configuring a Scene are detailed below:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Scene Name</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The title of the scene that will appear in the Scenes directory in the sidebar and in the Scene navigation bar at the top of the screen.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Journal Notes</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>An existing Journal Entry which is linked to this Scene as a set of notes which can be conveniently accessed through the context menu from the navigation or sidebar.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Scene Appearance</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Background Image</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The file path or web address of the background image you wish to use for your scene. The icon to the right of the field will open a File Picker that helps you to locate images within your public directory.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Width</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The rendered width of your scene, in pixels. If you do not fill this field out, the application will figure out the width automatically once the image is loaded.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Height</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The rendered height of your scene, in pixels. If you do not fill this field out, the application will figure out the width automatically once the image is loaded.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Background Color</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>A background color to fill behind the Scene background image.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Grid Settings</h3>
<p>This configuration section is used to modify the grid type and alignment which is displayed as an overlay atop the Scene. Even if you are using a map that has a pre-drawn grid it is important to configure this section because the Foundry grid dictates the positions where Tokens are placed, how distance is measured, or how Measured Templates identify target spaces. Configuration of the Grid in Foundry uses three key concepts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The width (in pixels) of the image.</li>
	<li>The height (in pixels) of the image.</li>
	<li>The grid size (in pixels); the number of pixels which represent a single grid space.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, suppose you have a map with a pre-drawn square grid which has 22 grid spaces in width and 18 grid spaces in height. The original map image is 3080px by 2520px. By knowing the dimensions of the image and by counting the number of grid spaces displayed on the map we can learn that the intended grid size for this map is 140px per square.</p>

<p class="note info">Foundry Virtual Tabletop enforces a minimum grid size of 50px. If your map uses a grid size lower than 50px you can still use it by increasing the background size. The easiest solution is to multiply all 3 of the width, height, and grid size by two to double every dimension.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Grid Type</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop supports multiple grid types which can be configured on a per-Scene basis. The following options are supported:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Gridless</dt>
			<dd>No fixed grid is used on this Scene allowing free-form point-to-point measurement without grid lines.</dd>
			<dt>Square</dt>
			<dd>A square grid is used with width and height of each grid space equal to the chosen grid size.</dd>
			<dt>Hexagonal Rows - Odd</dt>
			<dd>A row-wise hexagon grid (pointy-topped) where odd-numbered columns are offset.</dd>
			<dt>Hexagonal Rows - Even</dt>
			<dd>A row-wise hexagon grid (pointy-topped) where even-numbered columns are offset.</dd>
			<dt>Hexagonal Columns - Odd</dt>
			<dd>A column-wise hexagon grid (flat-topped) where odd-numbered rows are offset.</dd>
			<dt>Hexagonal Columns - Even</dt>
			<dd>A column-wise hexagon grid (flat-topped) where even-numbered rows are offset.</dd>
		</dl>
	</dd>
    <dt>Grid Size</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The grid size, in pixels, that should be used to define grid squares within the Scene. The grid is drawn starting from the top-left corner of the map image.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Shift Horizontal</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Shift the background image horizontally by a number of pixels to better line up pre-drawn grid lines. Positive numbers shift the image to the right, negative numbers to the left.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Shift Vertical</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Shift the background image vertically by a number of pixels to better line up pre-drawn grid lines. Positive numbers shift the image down, negative numbers up.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Grid Units</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The unit of measure that each square of space represents in this map. For battlemaps this may be on the order of feet or meters, for a large region map each individual grid space could represent miles or kilometers. You may put whatever string value you wish in this field, it is only used for tooltip displays when measuring.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Grid Distance</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The number of grid units which each space represents. For example, in a battlemap if the Grid Units are feet then a single square might represent 5 units of distance.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Grid Color</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Customize the color of the rendered grid.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Grid Opacity</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Customize the transparency of the grid. Higher opacity results in a less transparent grid, and vice versa. If you set this slider all the way to zero (left) the grid will not be visible at all.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note info">If your background image has a visible grid already incorporated into the image and you are having trouble aligning the Foundry grid with the pre-existing one, be sure to use the <strong>Grid Alignment Tool</strong> by clicking the angled-ruler icon to the right of the Grid Type dropdown which has a specialized tool and workflow to assist with this process.</p>

<h3>Lighting and Vision</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Token Vision</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>If this setting is enabled, visibility of the scene will require ownership of a Token which is placed in the scene and has a vision setting. If this setting is disabled, players will be able to see a scene even if they do not have a token present. This setting must be enabled to make use of Fog of War and Dynamic Lighting features.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Global Illumination</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>If this setting is enabled, the entire scene will be affected by Bright Light, allowing full visibility for any areas of the scene where an owned token has line-of-sight. This setting will have no effect if Token Vision is disabled.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Fog Exploration Illumination</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>If this setting is enabled, fog-of-war exploration will be tracked on a per-User basis and stored to the database as the Scene is explored. If this setting is disabled, fog exploration does not occur and instead Tokens are limited to only see their current vision polygon.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Darkness Level</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Control a day/night transition for the Scene where a darkness level of zero corresponds to full daylight and a darkness level of one corresponds to the strongest level of darkness.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Ambience and Atmosphere</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Audio Playlist</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Define a reference to an existing Audio Playlist which will begin automatically playing when this Scene is activated.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Weather Effect</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Define an available ambient weather effect which should be applied to this Scene.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Initial View Position</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Define the coordinates of an initial camera position which would define the starting view position for a character which <em>does not</em> have a controlled Token in the Scene. Players who have a Token in the Scene will begin their view centered on their Token location.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Access Controls</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Accessibility</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Scenes may be kept as &ldquo;GM Only&rdquo; in which case players will not be able to access them unless the a Gamemaster user activates the scene. If accessibility is set to All Players, then players may choose to view the scene themselves if it is available in the navigation bar. You probably what to keep your secret dungeon level set to GM Only while alternatively it makes sense to set region map the party is exploring to be viewed by &ldquo;All Players&rdquo;.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Show in Navigation</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>If this setting is enabled, the scene will appear in the Navigation bar at the top of the screen. This navigation menu is best used for scenes you plan to actively use during the course of a game session for convenient access. You can also add or remove scenes from the navigation menu by right clicking on the Scene in the sidebar directory.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>Navigation Name</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Override the text of the Scene Name that is displayed in the Navigation Bar for cases when it is important to avoid spoilers from revealing the true Scene name.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>
<hr/>

<h2>Scene Context Options</h2>

<p>Scenes which are displayed in the Navigation bar will appear at the top of the screen. The navigation bar is intended to act similarly to "bookmarks" for commonly used Scenes which are expected to be used during the game session. You may have many more Scenes in your World than you wish to keep in the Navigation bar at any given time. Remember that players can access Scenes in the navigation bar also if they are not set to <strong>GM Only</strong>.</p>
