<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop includes built-in technology to allow for audio/video (A/V) conferencing between all of the players in your game. The WebRTC framework used is called <em>simple-peer</em>, and relies on direct peer-to-peer connections to establish audio and video conferencing, and leverages the inherent infrastructure in Foundry VTT to do so.</p>
<p>This article will cover the steps necessary to set up A/V integration using a self-signed certification, the A/V Configuration menu and its various options and a technical explanation of A/V integration for users interested in a more detailed understanding of the system.</p>
<p>Video conferencing can consume a significant amount of bandwidth. If your upload speed is relatively low, you may wish to consider alternate services for video conferencing while running your games. This can be understandably inconvenient if the purpose of getting Foundry VTT was to contain your video and audio chat and have it display as an overlay- use of third party relay servers can help mitigate some of the network usage, but the best option if you have insufficient upload speed to support video conferencing is to host Foundry VTT through a third party service.</p>
<h2 class="border">Enabling A/V Chat Integration</h2>
<p>The fastest way to set up Audio/Video integration is via a self-signed SSL certificate. Creating your own SSL certificate is easy and more secure than not having an SSL certificate, but is not the most secure option available. This setup will serve most users well without issue, but an optional, more complex, higher security route is available via the @Article[ssl] article.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Creating a Self-Signed Certificate</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Go to:&nbsp;<a href="https://selfsigned.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://selfsigned.org/</a></li>
  <li>Enter <strong>localhost</strong> as the server name, and click generate.</li>
  <li>Download the certificate (<code>localhost.pem</code>) and key files (<code>localhost.key</code>), saving them somewhere you can easily find them.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Action 2: Configure Foundry VTT to use this certificate</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the certificate and the private key files you downloaded to your Foundry VTT's <code>Config</code> directory.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>On Windows and MacOS you can access this folder easily by right-clicking on Foundry VTT in your task bar or dock, selecting 'Browse User Data', and opening the <code>Config</code> folder.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Enter their file names in the <strong>SSL Certificate</strong> (<code>localhost.pem</code>) and <strong>SSL Private Key</strong> (<code>localhost.key</code>) fields in the Configuration menu from within Foundry VTT.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Action 3: Enable A/V integration in Foundry VTT</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the Audio/Video Configuration menu within a loaded game world select the Audio/Video Conferencing Mode you want to use, and click Save Changes.</li>
</ol>
<p class="info note">When using a self-signed certificate, most browsers will warn users that they are entering an unsecured site when they visit it for the first time and periodically after that. Users may need to used advanced configuration to allow their browsers to accept self-signed certificates, and will need to click on the "Advanced" button and then "Proceed" after reloading the site to accept the certificate.</p>

<h2 class="border">A/V Configuration</h2>
<figure class="right">@Image[136]

</figure>
<p>From within the Foundry app, the <strong>AV Configuration</strong> panel is accessible from the <strong>Settings</strong> sidebar within your active World. This allows you to customize the A/V broadcast mode (including enabling or disabling it), configure a custom signaling or relay server, and designate your preferred webcam and microphone hardware. If no microphone or webcam appear in this list, the most likely cause is that the devices are already in use by another program. Refreshing the screen (<strong>ctrl+f5</strong>) after you have released the devices from other programs using them should resolve this.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Audio/Video Conferencing Mode</dt>
  <dd>Used to select whether you wish to disable A/V, transmit audio only, video only, or use both audio and video conferencing.</dd>
  <dt>Voice Broadcasting Mode</dt>
  <dd>The method by which your microphone activates to transmit audio. If always enabled, the microphone will continually broadcast. Voice activation will activate the microphone only when it crosses a threshold of volume. Push to talk uses the assigned push-to-talk hotkey to trigger microphone activation while it is held down.</dd>
  <dt>Push-to-Talk/Mute key:</dt>
  <dd>Assign the keyboard key to be used to trigger Push to Talk. To assign a key, simply click into the input field and then press the keyboard key you wish to use. By default this is assigned to the backtick key: `</dd>
  <dt>Video Capture Device</dt>
  <dd>A list of available devices which can be used as a video source for video conferencing, choose your camera or video source here. If this list is empty or reads "Unknown Device", you may need to grant permission to use the camera for your browser, or to verify that no other programs are currently using the capture device.</dd>
  <dt>Audio Capture Device</dt>
  <dd>A list of available devices which can be used as an audio source, choose your microphone or audio source here. If this list is empty or reads "Unknown Device", you may need to grant permission to use the camera for your browser, or to verify that no other programs are currently using the capture device.</dd>
  <dt>Audio Output Device</dt>
  <dd>A list of available devices which FVTT should send audio-video to. By default, this is 'Default Device' which uses whichever device your OS uses as a primary sound output, but you can choose a specific output if you wish to output to headphones but not speakers, for example. (Please note that Firefox users will not see this option unless they have set <code>media.setsinkid.enabled</code> to true in their <code>about:config</code>).</dd>

<h2 id="built-in" class="border">How A/V Integration Works</h2>
<figure class="right">@Image[137]
  <figcaption>Audio/Video connections when peer-to-peer is functioning correctly.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Audio-Video communication through Foundry VTT primarily uses peer-to-peer connections, which requires that all users need to have UDP ports allowed through software firewalls and routers in order to properly connect.</p>
<p>The first diagram on the right shows an example of a peer-to-peer conference, all users are connected to one another. When one user speaks, they transmit audio and video directly to all other users in the game, and all other users receive that information directly. If the connections are not configured correctly, participants in the A/V conference may be unable to connect to each other and audio and video streams between those users will fail to appear.</p>

<h4>More about Simple-Peer</h4>
<p>Simple-Peer is a free, open-source, concise API for WebRTC which facilitates the creation of peer-to-peer data, video, and audio calls in node.js.</p>

<h4>More about WebRTC</h4>
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open-source project geared toward enabling high-quality real-time conferencing applications for browsers and mobile platforms. It was initially released in 2011, and allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages through direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need to install plugins or download additional software.

<h2 class="border" id="jitsi">Using a Jitsi Server</h2>
<p>Jitsi is a free, open-source voice conferencing platform which can be used to provide an alternative to peer-to-peer WebRTC communications. By using Jitsi, all users connect to the Jitsi server instead of connecting directly to each other. This often removes the necessity for port forwarding (if the Jitsi server is not hosted on your computer.) Through use of third party modules it is possible to WebRTC in Foundry Virtual Tabletop to use a Jitsi server for better performance and stability. Please see the following resources for more information about using Jitsi:</p>
