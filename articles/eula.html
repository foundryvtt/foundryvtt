<ol class="terms">
<li>You may create packages which utilize, reference, or duplicate portions of the software code.

When you publish changes to an existing package, it becomes bound by the most recent terms of this agreement.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not agree to the terms of this license, you may not publish package content. Any existing packages that were created under a previous version of this agreement may remain published provided they adhere to the license terms under which they were published.</p>
