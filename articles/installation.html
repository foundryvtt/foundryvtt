	<figcaption>A step-by-step guide to finding your license key and most recent download for Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you have purchased a Foundry license, the links to download the latest stable release of the software are available in the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/me/licenses">Foundry website account's "Licenses" tab</a> as shown above.</p>

<p>The Foundry VTT standalone application is the recommended installation path for most users: it bundles the Foundry game server software with a built-in Chromium web browser to serve as a client view, allowing you to interact with the server directly and conveniently. If you are planning on a more unusual configuration of Foundry (for example, a dedicated headless server), instructions are available <a href="#dedicated">later in this article.</a></p>
<p>You may have noticed the "Timed URL" button located next to the standard Download button. This alternate method can be convenient in certain cases, such as when you would like to allow a friend to download Foundry for you or if you need to download Foundry using a command line.</p>

            <div class="column">
                <p>Click the "Timed URL" button to generate a temporary Foundry download link. You can use this link in two different ways:
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Web browser</strong></dt>
                        <dd>To use the download link is to simply paste it into the address bar of your web browser. If the link is still valid, your download will begin automatically.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Command line</strong></dt>
                        <dd>Alternatively, this link can be used to download Foundry VTT using a command line utility such as <code>wget</code>. When using the link in the command, it is important to wrap the link in double-quotes. For example:
                            <pre><code class="language bash">wget -O foundryvtt.zip "PASTED-URL-FROM-FOUNDRY-WEBSITE-HERE"</code></pre>

<h2 id="installing" class="border">Installing The Software</h2>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header id="windowsinstall" class="collapsible-header">Installation - Windows</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>If you are using the Windows version of Foundry VTT there is an installation process necessary once you have downloaded the installer. To install the software, run the setup executable file that you downloaded.</p>
        <p>During the installation process you will be asked for an installation location. Despite being the default path for installation, it is recommended to install Foundry VTT in a location not contained within the Program Files directory, as this can result in some permission issues when updating the software.</p>
        <p> Once installation is complete, you can launch Foundry VTT using either the shortcut in the start menu, on your desktop, or by running the FoundryVTT.exe file located within your installation location.</p>
        <h4>Microsoft Defender SmartScreen</h4>
        <p>In rare cases you may see a warning message from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. To allow Foundry Virtual Tabletop to pass the Defender SmartScreen, click <strong>More Info</strong> and then click <strong>Run Anyway</strong> Alternatively, if you have stronger security settings applied, you may need to right-click the file, click Properties, and mark the checkbox <strong>Unblock</strong> in the Security section.</p>

    <header id="macinstall" class="collapsible-header">Installation - macOS</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>If you are using the macOS version of Foundry VTT, there are some steps which are required to allow you to run the app.</p> 
        <p>Because the macOS copy of Foundry VTT is not code-signed through Apple's developer process, you may see a notification when you try to run the app that advises you that the application cannot be opened.</p>
        <p class="info note"><strong>Note:</strong> More information on this security process from Apple can be found <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202491" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>

    <header id="linuxinstall" class="collapsible-header">Installation - Linux</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>For Linux users, Foundry Virtual Tabletop is currently distributed as a simple <code><strong>.zip</strong></code> archive. All you need to do is extract the zip file in a location of your choosing. Feel free to choose whatever installation location is best for you, a simple option would be to use a folder named foundryvtt in your user home directory.</p> <pre><code>unzip foundryvtt.zip -d $HOME/foundryvtt</code></pre>
        <p>Once you have extracted the archive, locate the <code>foundryvtt</code> file in the directory and set the permission on it to allow execution as a program. This will allow you to execute it from the terminal with <code>./foundryvtt</code>. Alternatively, on some Linux distributions (Deb/Ubuntu) you can rename the <code>foundryvtt</code> file to add a .sh extension. This will allow you to quickly launch it by double-clicking. At this time there is no Linux .desktop packaged with Foundry VTT.</p>

<h3 id="service" class="border">Running as a Service</h3>
<p>If you wish to keep the server running perpetually, you may wish to run Foundry VTT using a process manager like <a href="https://systemd.io/" target="_blank">systemd</a> which is recommended for standalone installations or <a href="https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/" target="_blank">PM2</a> which is recommended for operating a cluster of instances.
