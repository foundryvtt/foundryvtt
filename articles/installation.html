    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>To install the Foundry VTT Desktop application, run the setup executable file as usual.</p> 
        <p> <em>(Optional)</em>: if you choose a custom installation location outside the usual Program Files directory, you may avoid some potential hassles with Windows permissions while updating the software.</p>
        <p class="info note"><strong>Note: </strong>A convenient <a href="#portable">Windows portable build</a> is also available for Foundry VTT Version 13 and newer. This allows easily installing <a href="#multiple">multiple versions</a> at once.</p>

        <p>If you are using the macOS version of Foundry VTT, there are some steps which are required to allow you to run the app.</p> 
        <p>Because the macOS copy of Foundry VTT is not code-signed through Apple's official process, you may see a notification when you try to run the app that advises you that the application cannot be opened.</p>

    <header id="linuxinstall" class="collapsible-header">Installation - Linux</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>For Linux users, Foundry Virtual Tabletop is currently distributed as a simple <code><strong>.zip</strong></code> archive. All you need to do is extract the zip file in a location of your choosing. Feel free to choose whatever installation location is best for you, a simple option would be to use a folder named foundryvtt in your user home directory.</p> <pre><code>unzip foundryvtt.zip -d $HOME/foundryvtt</code></pre>
        <p>Once you have extracted the archive, locate the <code>foundryvtt</code> file in the directory and set the permission on it to allow execution as a program. This will allow you to execute it from the terminal with <code>./foundryvtt</code>. Alternatively, on some Linux distributions (Deb/Ubuntu) you can rename the <code>foundryvtt</code> file to add a .sh extension. This will allow you to quickly launch it by double-clicking. At this time there is no Linux .desktop packaged with Foundry VTT.</p>
        <p>Another option for Linux users to consider is using the <a href="#build-types">Node</a> installer. It is a bit lighter-weight than the traditional Linux installer and may be more compatible with certain architectures.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="options">Additional Installation Options</h2>
<p>For simplicity, the <a href="#recommended">recommended installation process</a> often provided instructions to pick a single option out of many.

<section class="collapsible">
    <header id="version-options" class="collapsible-header">Version Options</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>In addition to the current Recommended version, there are many other versions of Foundry VTT available in the "Versions" dropdown menu that experienced Foundry users might want to choose under certain circumstances:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Older Stable versions</dt>
                <dd>Foundry VTT never forces you to update versions, and some users choose to download an older Stable version for that is more compatibility with a favorite game system or module.</dd>
            <dt>Experimental versions</dt>
                <dd>During the Foundry VTT development cycle, experimental builds are classified as Prototype, Development, or Testing so that community developers and power users can follow along with our progress and offer feedback.</dd>

                <p>Although these options are called "Operating System" options, it's perhaps more useful to think of these options as "build types" for Foundry VTT. Five different Foundry VTT build types are currently available:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>The "Windows", "macOS", and "Linux" Installers</dt>

                        <dd>The Foundry VTT desktop application that they create includes both a light-weight Foundry game server and a built-in, specialized Chromium web browser.

        <p>Previously, the legacy "Linux/Node" installer was used to install both the Linux desktop application and the Node version of Foundry vtt (for Linux, macOS, and Windows). Separating the Linux and Node installation process allows us to provide leaner installers.</p>
        <p>The two new installers were not retroactively created for past versions of Foundry VTT. The "Linux" versions that are available for versions of Foundry VTT prior to version 13.338 are the exact same artifacts that were previously called the "Linux/Node" installers, just with a revised name.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Sometimes users prefer to deliberately install an older version of Foundry VTT rather than the latest Stable version. This happens most frequently just after a new Stable version of Foundry VTT is released and a particular game system or module has not yet updated to the new version.</p>
        <p>When considering which version of to use, it is important to know that when a world is launched in a newer version of Foundry VTT for the first time, an automatic data migration may begin automatically.</p>
        <p class="warning note">After a data migration, the World may no longer be launchable in older versions of Foundry VTT. This cannot be reversed except by reverting to a backup.</p>

    <header id="portable" class="collapsible-header">Installing a "portable" version of Foundry VTT</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>A "portable" application is one that can be installed and run anywhere, such as on a USB stick or a dedicated external hard drive. This can be particularly useful when you are preparing for a game in one location, and then running the game from a different machine. This may happen while traveling, or when you are running an in-person game that is enhanced by using Foundry VTT connected to a physical display.</p>
        <p>The best way of setting up a portable build depends on your operating system:</p>

                        <dt>Windows</dt>
                            <dd>Foundry installations created using the <a href="#build-types">Windows Portable Installer</a> can be completely self-contained within a single folder, so multiple independent installations can be achieved just by using the appropriate Windows Portable builds in inside different folders. For additional information, see <a href="#windows-portable">The Windows Portable Build</a> below.</dd>
                        <dt>macOS and Linux</dt>
                            <dd>The architecture of macOS and Linux are much more friendly to running portable applications, so no dedicated Foundry VTT build is required. Folder-level Foundry installations are possible in macOS and Linux by using only the Node.js installer. For macOS users, there's a <a href="https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/setup/hosting/macos-node">community-created guide</a> on the topic that may particularly helpful.</dd>
                    </dl>
        <h3 class="border" id="windows-portable">The Windows Portable Build</h3>
        <p><span class="V12">New for Foundry V13,</span> the Windows Portable Build isn't a traditional Windows installer at all. Instead, the "installer" is a single zip that can be extracted anywhere to create a self-contained version of Foundry VTT in that location.</p>
        <p>The process of deploying and using a Windows Portable Build is quite simple:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the <a href="#recommended">recommended installation process</a>, but pick "Windows Portable Build" from the "Operating System" dropdown instead of "Windows"</li>
            <li>Extract the downloaded zip file to the location you want to run Foundry VTT</li>
            <li>Open the <code>App</code> folder, then double-click the <code>Foundry Virtual Tabletop.exe</code> file to launch it</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When the <code>Foundry Virtual Tabletop.exe</code> file inside the <code>App</code> folder is run for the first time, Foundry VTT automatically creates three new folders in its parent directory- <code>Config</code>, <code>Data</code>, and <code>Logs</code> and automatically defaults to using them.</p>
        <p>This portable installation is configured to use those folders by default for two important reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All the folders and files that Foundry VTT needs are already in one location for easy "out of the box" portability</li>
            <li>If you are using the portable build <a href="#multiple-versions">for testing purposes by running an experimental or newer copy of Foundry VTT</a>, you are less likely to affect your "real" data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because a fresh <code>Config</code> folder is created, this portable version of Foundry VTT starts out with a clean set of user settings which means that some setup steps may be necessary that you wouldn't normally have to perform when installing a new version of Foundry VTT, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Entering your Foundry VTT software license key</li>
            <li>Accepting the license agreement and data sharing</li>
            <li>Potentially configuring Foundry VTT to use your GPU, if needed</li>
            <!-- TODO: add graphics step to standard installation -->
        </ol>
        <p>For more information about these steps, see the <a href="#recommended">recommended Foundry VTT</a> installation process.</p>
        <p>Other than its unusual installation process and first-run configuration steps, the Windows Portable build operates the same as any other Foundry VTT instance. For example, you are not required to use the built-in "Data" folder as the Foundry User Data path, and you can <a href="/article/configuration">change it using the Setup screen</a> as usual if you so choose.</p>
        <h5 id="windows-portable-example">Windows Portable Build Example</h5>
             <p>For example, this is what happens if a user decides to install the (non-existent) Foundry Version 12.345 onto a USB drive that Windows has registered as <code>E:\</code></p>
        <pre><code>E:\
            ├──FOUNDRYVTT-PORTABLE-12.345

        <h3 id="multiple" class="border">Running multiple copies of Foundry VTT on the Same Machine</h3>
        <p>Particularly around the release of a major new version of Foundry VTT releases, it can be quite useful to have more than one version of Foundry VTT installed.</p>
        <p>Using this approach, you can safely experience the new version of Foundry VTT first-hand and see how your favorite modules and game systems perform without affecting your "real" data. You can even use this method to run live campaigns on your machine using different versions of Foundry VTT, which may happen if one of your preferred game systems is particularly slow to update, for example.</p>
        <p class="info note"><strong>Please Note</strong>: As always, be sure to take a <a href="/article/backups">backup</a> before making major changes to your Foundry VTT installation or User Data.</p>
        <p>The best way to install multiple copies of Foundry VTT on a single machine is to configure multiple independent <a href="#portable">portable</a> installations of Foundry VTT, each in their own folder and using separate User Data folders.</p>
        <p>It is even possible to run multiple versions of Foundry VTT on the same machine <em>simultaneously</em>, if you take a few precautions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each copy of Foundry VTT needs to have its own port number</li>
            <li>You will also need to have a separate Foundry User Data folder for each instance of Foundry</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to have external users to connect to one or more of these simultaneously-running worlds, there are some additional things to consider</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may need to set up port forwarding separately for additional ports</li>
            <li>You may need additional Foundry VTT license(s) to ensure that you <a href="/article/faq/#license-usage">abide by the terms of the license agreement</a>.</li>
        </ul>

 <h3 id="dedicated" class="border">Hosting a Dedicated Server with Node.js</h3>
<p class="info note"><b>Note:</b> Installing Node.js manually as described below is not part of the typical Foundry installation process.</p>
<p>Most users can simply install Foundry <a href="#installing">using the standard Windows, macOS, or Linux installer</a>. If you are an advanced user who is planning on a more unusual method of running Foundry (such as creating a dedicated headless Foundry server), this section describes how to install Foundry VTT as a Node.js package.</p>
<section class="collapsible">
    <header id="install-node" class="collapsible-header">Installing Node.js</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>To use the Node.js version of Foundry VTT, you must first install Node.js on a machine that meets the <a href="/article/requirements/#dedicated-server">minimum requirements to function as a dedicated Foundry server</a>.
The minimum required Node version is 20.18, but using the latest stable version of Node.js 22.x is recommended.</p> 
        <p class="info note"><strong>Note:</strong> Node 24.x is not fully compatible with Version 13. Also, remember that odd numbered major versions (such as 21.x or 23.x) are not considered stable.</p>
        <p>If your server runs the Windows or macOS operating system, you can just use the installers available here <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">https://nodejs.org/en/download</a>.</p>

<h4 id="extract-node">Downloading, Extracting and Launching the Server</h4>
<p>Next, you will need to download Foundry. Use the standard instructions "<a href="#downloading">Downloading Foundry</a>" above, but be sure to pick the "Node.js" option in the "Operating System" dropdown menu.</p>
<p class="note info"><strong>Note</strong>: The separate "Node.js" installer only exists for Version 13+. For older versions of Foundry VTT, use the Linux installer which also includes the necessary Node.js files.</p>
<p>Now that you have downloaded Foundry VTT and installed Node.js, it's time to extract the zip, create your data directory and launch your Node.JS server. This process varies depending on  the operating system of your server.</p>

<h4 id="service" >Running as a Service</h4>
<p>If you wish to keep the server running perpetually, you may wish to run Foundry VTT using a process manager like <a href="https://systemd.io/" target="_blank">systemd</a> which is recommended for standalone installations or <a href="https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/" target="_blank">PM2</a> which is recommended for operating a cluster of instances.
