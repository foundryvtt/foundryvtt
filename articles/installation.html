</figure>
<p>To download Foundry Virtual Tabletop you must be a software license owner, if you have purchased a license the links to download the latest stable release of the software are available on your user profile as shown above.</p>

<p>The Foundry VTT standalone application is the recommended installation path for most users: it bundles the the Foundry game server software with a built-in chromium web browser to serve as a client view, allowing you to interact with the server directly and conveniently. If you are planning to host a dedicated server instead, you will want to install the Node.js version. Full instructions for this process are described <a href="#dedicated">later in this article.</a></p>

<h3 id="timedurl">Downloading Foundry via a Timed URL</h3>
<p>In addition to the standard download button, there is a "Timed URL" download option in the Foundry website. This alternate method can be convenient in rarer cases when you need to download Foundry via command line, or to temporarily allow a friend to download a Foundry installer without sharing your Foundry credentials.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Clicking the "Timed URL" button generates a temporary link which can be used to help download download Foundry VTT. This can be pasted into a web browser, or it can be used to download via a terminal or shell interface using wget.</p>
        <p>When downloading the link using a command line utility such as <code>wget</code> it's important to wrap the link in double-quotes. This ensures that the link is read correctly by the command. For example: </p>
        <pre><code class="language bash">wget -O foundryvtt.zip "PASTED-URL-FROM-FOUNDRY-WEBSITE-HERE"</code></pre>
        <p class="info note">Please be aware that the download links provided via the purchased licenses page expire every 5 minutes.</p>

<h2>Installing Foundry VTT</h2>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header id="windowsinstall" class="collapsible-header">Installation - Windows</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>If you are using the Windows version of Foundry VTT there is an installation process necessary once you have downloaded the installer. To install the software, run the setup executable file that you downloaded.</p>
        <p>During the installation process you will be asked for an installation location. Despite being the default path for installation, it is recommended to install Foundry VTT in a location not contained within the Program Files directory, as this can result in some permission issues when updating the software.</p>
        <p> Once installation is complete, you can launch Foundry VTT using either the shortcut in the start menu, on your desktop, or by running the FoundryVTT.exe file located within your installation location.</p>
        <h4>Microsoft Defender SmartScreen</h4>
        <p>In rare cases you may see a warning message from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. To allow Foundry Virtual Tabletop to pass the Defender SmartScreen, click <strong>More Info</strong> and then click <strong>Run Anyway</strong> Alternatively, if you have stronger security settings applied, you may need to right click the file, click Properties, and mark the checkbox <strong>Unblock</strong> in the Security section.</p>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header id="macinstall" class="collapsible-header">Installation - macOS</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>If you are using the macOS version of Foundry VTT, there are some steps which are required to allow you to run the app. As the macOS copy of Foundry VTT is not code-signed through Apple's developer process, you may see a notification when you try to run the app, advising you that the application cannot be opened "because it was not downloaded from the app store" or "because the developer cannot be verified." (More information on this security process from Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202491" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.)</p>
        <p>To install Foundry VTT and allow the app to launch, do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the downloaded <strong>.dmg</strong> file.</li>
            <li>Drag the Foundry VTT app icon to the Applications folder.</li>
            <li>Open your Applications folder, and <strong>right-click</strong> on the Foundry VTT app. Choose "Open".</li>
            <li>A prompt will appear: <em>"Foundry Virtual Tabletop" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified. macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.</em></li>
            <li>Press "Cancel".</li>
            <li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the Foundry VTT app again and choose "Open".</li>
            <li>Another prompt will appear:&nbsp;<em>macOS cannot verify the developer of "Foundry Virtual Tabletop". Are you sure you want to open it?</em></li>
            <li>Click "Open".</li>
            <li>The app will launch, and can now be opened in the future by double-clicking it or launching it from the Dock.</li>

    <header id="linuxinstall" class="collapsible-header">Installation - Linux</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>For Linux users, Foundry Virtual Tabletop is currently distributed as a simple <code><strong>.zip</strong></code> archive. All you need to do is extract the zip file in a location of your choosing. Feel free to choose whatever installation location is best for you, a simple option would be to use a folder named foundryvtt in your user home directory.</p> <pre><code>unzip foundryvtt.zip -d $HOME/foundryvtt</code></pre>
        <p>Once you have extracted the archive, locate the <code>foundryvtt</code> file in the directory and set the permission on it to allow execution as a program. This will allow you to execute it from the terminal with <code>./foundryvtt</code>. Alternatively, on some Linux distributions (Deb/Ubuntu) you can rename the <code>foundryvtt</code> file to add a .sh extension. This will allow you to quickly launch it by double-clicking. At this time there is no Linux .desktop packaged with FVTT.</p>

<h2 id="dedicated" class="border">Hosting a Dedicated Server with NodeJS</h2>
<p>If you are planning to host and run Foundry Virtual Tabletop as a dedicated server rather than a client application, FVTT is also available as a NodeJS package. The NodeJS version of the package is available from the Purchased Licenses page mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Installing NodeJS</h3>
<p>To use the NodeJS package, you must first install NodeJS.</p> 
<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">Installing NodeJS on Windows and Mac OS</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        If your server runs the Windows or Mac OS operating system, use the installers available here <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">https://nodejs.org/en/download</a>.

<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">Installing NodeJS on Linux</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Node Version Manager (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), or NVM, is the recommended method of installing Node for use on a Linux-based Foundry server.</p> 

        <p>If you are uncertain whether NVM is already installed on your server, you can easily double-check. If NVM is properly installed, the following bash script should output `NVM`:</p>
        <pre><code>$ nvm -v</code></pre>
        <p>If NVM is not installed, install it now using the following bash scripts:</p>
        <pre><code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash</code></pre>
        <p>then</p>
        <pre><code>$ source ~/.bashrc</code></pre>

        <p>Once you are certain that NVM is installed, you can use it to install the latest version of Node:</p>
        <pre><code>$ nvm install node</code></pre>
        <p>Next, activate that version of node:</p>
        <pre><code>$ nvm use node</code></pre>
        <p>Finally, you can verify that Node installation was successful and check the version that was installed with the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>$ node --version</code></pre>

        <p class="note info">Note that a relatively modern version of Node.js is required in order to support various security features which are required by the application. If possible, please use Node.js version 16.x or newer.</p>
