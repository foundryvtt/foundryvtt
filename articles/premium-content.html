        <h3 class="border">Premium Content and the Foundry VTT Marketplace</h3>
        <p>Foundry's pre-existing premium content system that it has used since it first launched still exists for products that are not part of the new Foundry VTT Marketplace. The process still works the same way it always did, and every premium content product still has its own listing in the <a href="/packages/premium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Premium Content</a> category, whether or not it is part of the official Foundry VTT Marketplace.</p>

<p>You can get access to Foundry VTT external premium content (that is, premium content that is not available on the <a href="https://foundryvtt.store">official Foundry VTT Marketplace</a>) by purchasing a content key or by subscribing to a creator on Patreon and linking your Patreon account to your Foundry VTT account. The instructions below will walk you through how to activate content from both sources:</p>

<div class="columns">
    <section class="collapsible"><header class="collapsible-header">Content Key</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>As part of the checkout process when purchasing external premium content for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, you should receive an email containing a content activation key. If you have not received a content key for your purchase after 15 minutes, please reach out to the publisher from whom you purchased the content. Redeeming the content key will activate the content for your Foundry Virtual Tabletop account, and that key can no longer be used for any other account. It is important to make sure you are activating the content key on the correct account.</p>
            <h4>To activate a key:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Log-in to the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/" target="_blank">Foundry Virtual Tabletop website</a></li>
                <li>Head to your <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/me/purchases" target="_blank">Purchased Content</a> page</li>
                <li>Copy and paste your content key into the <strong>Content Key</strong> field</li>
                <li>Click the <strong>Activate Content</strong> button</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once activated, the Content Key is added to your account and no further steps are required. Your new premium content will appear in your "Unlocked Premium Content" list, showcasing what content you have permission to access via the Premium Content section of the package installer in Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you purchased your item from the Foundry VTT Marketplace or directly from a content creator, installation of premium content occurs through the in-application Package Installer on the Setup and Configuration page of Foundry Virtual Tabletop. Take note of the type of content you purchased, it may be a World, Game System, or Module. If you aren't certain which category your newly purchased content falls into, check the content's page on the Foundry VTT website to identify it (though it is usually an Add-on Module).</p>
<h4>To install premium content:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>From the Setup menu within Foundry VTT, select the appropriate tab for your content: <span class="reference">Game Worlds</span>, <span class="reference">Game Systems</span>, or <span class="reference">Add-on Modules</span>.</li>
    <li>On this tab, click the <span class="reference">Install</span> button near the top of the screen.</li>
    <li>In the installation menu that displays, filter the view by clicking the <span class="reference">Premium Content</span> category on the left hand side.</li>
    <li>Locate your premium content within the list or use the filter field to search for it and click the <span class="reference">Install</span> button on the right-hand side.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your content displays "Not Owned" instead of an installation button please verify that you have activated the content for your account.</p>

</figure>
<p>Similarly, all premium content needs to be activated inside your World, just like any other module. Here's what to do:</p>
<h4>To activate premium content:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In your World change to the <span class="reference"><i class="fas fa-cogs"> </i></span> Settings tab.</li>
    <li>On this tab, click the <span class="reference">Manage Modules</span> button</li>
    <li>In the window that appears, you can either find your content in the list or filter the view by clicking into the <span class="reference">Filter Modules</span> field and typing the name of the module.</li>
    <li>Locate your Premium Content within the list, check the box to its left and click the <span class="reference">Save Module Settings</span> button at the bottom.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your content should now be active in your World and all its content and features should now be available.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="finding">Finding and Using Your New Premium Content</h2>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <p>Even after activating your new module, it may not look like anything has changed. This is particularly true of content modules such as adventures, audio packs, or "rulebooks" because typically this content is initially packaged up inside a Compendium until you pull it into your World.</p>
        <h4>To find and use your new premium content, try this:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In your World change to the <span class="reference"><i class="fas fa-book-atlas"> </i></span> Compendiums tab.</li>
            <li>On this tab, look for a folder that has the same name as the content you just purchased</li>
            <li>Expand the folder, double click each compendium, and import the content that you need into your World.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once it is imported, your content will appear in the appropriate sidebar tabs as usual.</p>
        <p class="note info"><strong>TIP:</strong> Only import the content that you actually plan on using! Importing large amounts of unnecessary content "just because" only serves to make your World a bit more sluggish.</p>
