<p><a title="Nginx Web Server" href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nginx</a> is a popular web server which you may consider using as a proxy server in front of Foundry Virtual Tabletop. There are a number of advantages to using a proxy server like Nginx like using a subdomain, using an external port that is different than your Foundry VTT port, stronger access controls, and faster serving of static files. This article provides a basic overview of using Nginx with Foundry Virtual Tabletop. There are <em>many advanced options</em> which are not covered here.</p>
<p class="note info">Please note that using a proxy server like Nginx, while advantageous for dedicated web hosts, is absolutely not required in order to use Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</p>
<h2 class="border" id="install">Step 1 - Install Nginx</h2>
<p>Start by installing Nginx for your Linux distribution. Some common examples are provided below, but consult the <a title="Nginx documentation" href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nginx documentation</a> for your Linux flavor.</p>
<p class="note warning">This guide assumes a basic level of familiarity with the Linux operating system and how to interface with it. If you are brand new to Linux we recommend starting with a beginner's tutorial to the Linux command line before proceeding.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="configure">Step 2 - Configure Nginx</h2>
<p>Nginx requires a configuration file which defines how the server functions. A functional starting point to begin testing Nginx is the following configuration which does not use SSL certificates (we can enable those later). For the purposes of this example we assume that Foundry Virtual Tabletop is running from <code>/home/ec2-user/foundryvtt</code>, but your application installation path may be different, you should adjust the configuration file accordingly.</p>
<p class="note warning">Make sure to update the references to <code>your.hostname.com</code> in the configuration.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <pre><code class="language-bash"># This goes in a file within /etc/nginx/sites-available/. By convention,
        # the filename would be either "your.domain.com" or "foundryvtt", but it
        # really does not matter as long as it's unique and descriptive for you.
        
        # Define Server
        server {
        
            # Enter your fully qualified domain name or leave blank
            server_name             your.hostname.com;
        
            # Listen on port 80 without SSL certificates
            listen                  80;

            # Proxy Requests to Foundry VTT
            location / {
        
                # Set proxy headers
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;

                proxy_pass http://localhost:30000;
            }
        }
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    </section>

<p>Once you have configured Nginx, there are some configurations for Foundry Virtual Tabletop in the @Article[configuration] article you will also want to apply. Set the following options in your Foundry VTT <code>{userData}/Config/options.json</code> file which will instruct Foundry that the server is running with a proxy server in front of it on port 80.</p>
<p class="note warn"> This is where you should update any port-forwarding or access control rules to allow connection to your server on the ports you are allowing through NGINX. For more information please see: @Article[port-forwarding]</p>
</p>
<p class="note info">Please be aware that if your Foundry VTT location is hosted at a subfolder location, such as <code>mysite.com/foundryvtt</code>, you will need to define a routePrefix as outlined in the @Article[configuration] article.</p>

        "port": 30000,
        "proxyPort": 80
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    </section>

<p>Once you have configured your reverse proxy, you will want to restart the proxy instance as well as your Foundry VTT instance to ensure that the new settings are active.</p>
<h2 class="border" id="control">Step 3 - Start, Stop, and Restart Nginx</h2>
<p>You can use the <code>service</code> utility to easily manage your Nginx server.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Enable new site
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your.hostname.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Test your configuration file, please note that on some OS versions this may be "sudo service nginx configtest" instead
sudo service nginx conftest

# Start Nginx
sudo service nginx start

# Stop Nginx
sudo service nginx stop

# Restart Nginx
sudo service nginx restart
</code></pre>
<h2 class="border" id="ssl">Step 4 - Add SSL Certificates (Optional)</h2>
<p>For more advanced usage you can add SSL Certificates for added security. Start by creating SSL Certificates, we recommend <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/instructions" title="Certbot SSL Certificates Instructions" target="_blank">using Certbot</a>, for which our @Article[ssl] article can offer some assistance. Once your certificates are created, your Nginx configuration file will be updated to use port 443 and the SSL certificates you have created.</p>
<p class="note warning">Make sure to update the references to <code>your.hostname.com</code> in the configuration.</p>

            }
        }
        
        # Optional, but recommend. Redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS for you
        server {
            if ($host = your.hostname.com) {
                return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
            }
        
            listen 80;
            listen [::]:80;

            return 404;
        }

<p>Once you have edited the Nginx configuration to include your SSL certificates, be sure to do a configuration test before restarting your server. Lastly, there are some additional configuration options for Foundry Virtual Tabletop you will also want to apply. Set the following options in your Foundry VTT <code>{userData}/Config/options.json</code> file which will instruct Foundry that the server is running with a proxy server in front of it on port 443.</p>
