<p>The following terms and conditions apply when purchasing premium content from the Foundry Virtual Tabletop store. If you have any questions or concerns about these terms please <a href="/contact-us" title="Contact Us" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>1. Payments</h2>

<h3>1a. Terms of Purchase</h3>
<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop uses <a href="https://stripe.com/" title="Stripe" target="_blank">Stripe</a> as a third-party payment processor to manage, authenticate, and process payment for purchases on this website. Please read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of Stripe for further details. When making a purchase you agree to provide Stripe with accurate billing information and payment method details and to pay all fees and applicable taxes.</p>

<h3>1b. Payment Methods</h3>
<p>Stripe supports payment via major international credit cards. In the EU several bank transfer methods are supported: Bancontact, EPS, giropay, iDeal, Przelewy24, and SEPA Debit. Stripe also supports Google Pay, Apple Pay, and AliPay for customers in some geographies.</p>
<p>Payments processed via <strong>SEPA Direct Debit</strong> will take extra time to process. Due to the time it takes banks to communicate this information to one another, payments can take up to 10 business days to process. There are two steps to the SEPA Debit workflow, in the first step Stripe submits a mandate to your bank which enacts the debit request. In the second phase the bank reports back to Stripe once the debit request has cleared. As a result, the charge may appear on your bank account 1-3 days before the purchase is fully completed. Please remain patient, and you will receive an email containing your issued license key information as soon as the successful charge is reported back to the Stripe platform.</p>
