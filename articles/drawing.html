<h2 id="types">Overview</h2>
<p>Drawing tools can be used to allow the GM and users to annotate the map with freehand or shaped drawings. The appearance of drawings can be pre-configured using defaults, or individual drawn shapes may have their appearance changed after they have been placed.</p>
<p>This article will teach you how to place and edit drawings in a scene.</p>
<h4 id="permissions">Drawing Tool Permissions</h4>
<p>By default, players do not have permission to use Drawing tools, while Trusted players and Assistant GMs have access to the drawing tools enabled by default. If you wish to allow or revoke permissions to the drawing tools, you can do so from the "Use Drawing Tools" section of the Permission Configuration in the @Article[settings] menu.</p>
<h2 class="border">Placing Drawings</h2>
<p>Placing drawings into a scene is extremely simple, and requires the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the drawing tool. This is a pencil icon on the left of the Foundry VTT UI.</li>
<li>Select the type of drawing you want to create. These include rectangles, ellipses, polygons, freehand and text.</li>
<li>Click and drag out the shape you want (for rectangle, ellipse, and text) or click to place points (for polygon), or click and hold to actively draw (with freehand).</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a drawing is created the drawing select tool allows you to select and move the drawing around the scene as you need. You can also right click on the drawing to quickly toggle the drawing's visibility, or to move it forward or backward for the purposes of determining if it sits on top of or below other drawings in the same area.</p>

<h2 class="border">Configuring Drawings</h2>
<p>Individual drawings can be modified after their placement by double clicking the drawing with the selection tool. Once the configuration menu is loaded, you will have access to multiple tabs that let you determine the specific appearance of the drawing's various aspects. The available tabs will be explained below.</p>
<figure class="right"><a title="See Larger Image" href="https://foundryvtt.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/website-media-dev/user_1294/screen/drawing-tools-position-2021-01-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">@Image[129]</a>
<figcaption>These are the Drawing Tools Position Settings.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Positioning Tab</h3>
<dl>
<dt>X &amp; Y Position (Pixels)</dt>
<dd>Set the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) placement of the drawing. This allows you to fine-tune the location of a drawing down to the pixel.</dd>
<dt>Width &amp; Height (Pixels)</dt>
<dd>Set the specific width and height of the drawing in pixels. This allows you to fine-tune the size and shape of the drawing down to the pixel.</dd>
<dt>Rotation (Degrees)</dt>
<dd>Set the degree of rotation to apply to the drawing.</dd>
<dt>Z-Sort</dt>
<dd>Set the "height" of the drawing in a stack of other drawings. The higher the z-sort number, the closer to the top of the stack of images the drawing will be, with the highest z-sort number being the one drawn on top of all other drawings.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Lines Tab</h3>
<figure class="right"><a title="See Larger Image" href="https://foundryvtt.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/website-media-dev/user_1294/screen/drawing-tools-lines-2021-01-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">@Image[130]</a>

<h3>Establishing Default Drawing Settings</h3>
<figure class="right"><a title="See Larger Image" href="https://foundryvtt.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/website-media-dev/user_1294/screen/drawing-tools-default-settings-2021-01-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">@Image[133]</a>
<figcaption>This is the Drawing Tool Default Settings Configuration screen. From here default appearance of all future drawings can be set.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The default appearance of drawings may be configured by using the "Configure Drawing" tool. This sets the defaults your drawings will adhere to when placed, and the defaults are specific to each user and their drawing tools.</p>
<p>The tabs of this menu are identical to the similarly named tabs of the individual drawing configuration menu, therefore you can reference the specific tab explanations above for what they do, and how they affect your drawings.</p>
