<p>Drawing tools can be used to allow the GM and users to annotate the map with freehand or shaped drawings. The appearance of drawings can be pre-configured using defaults, or individual drawn shapes may have their appearance changed after they have been placed.</p>

<h2>Drawing Tool Permissions</h2>

<p>By default, players do not have permission to use Drawing tools, while Trusted players and Assistant GMs have access to the drawing tools enabled by default. If you wish to allow or revoke permissions to the drawing tools, you can do so from the "Use Drawing Tools" section of the Permission Configuration in the @Article[settings] menu.</p>

<p>Drawings may be configured by using the "Configure Drawing" tool. This sets the defaults your drawings will adhere to when placed. In addition, individual drawings can be modified after their placement and any of the below settings changed via the configuration menu. To access the configuration menu for a particular drawing, simply doubleclick it.</p>
