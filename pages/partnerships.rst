Dungeon Fog is an online map maker & authoring tool for RPG game masters. With the extensive DUNGEONFOG Editor you
can draw your RPG tabletop maps with just a few clicks â€“ no more patching up map tiles! Create multi-level dungeons,
terrain, or entire worlds in an instant. Generate your GM-Notes automatically and export or print high-res images and
notes, or send a Fog of War version for your players to your TV!

Thanks to the hard work of community modders, Foundry Virtual Tabletop features a Dungeon Fog integration module which
can automatically configure walls and doors for the fog of war and ambient lighting system automatically by exporting
data directly from Dungeon Fog and importing into Foundry VTT. Learn more on the :ref:`modules` page.

To celebrate our partnership, you can use the discount code **FOUNDRY** when subscribing to the Dungeon Fog
service for a 10% discount on the price of subscription! Visit https://www.dungeonfog.com/foundry to take
